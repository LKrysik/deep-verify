# Deep Verify V3.0

**Deep Verify** is a rigorous, universal verification workflow designed for **LLM CLIs (e.g., Gemini CLI, Claude CLI)**. It transforms the verification of software artifacts—from code and documentation to architecture and product requirements—into a structured, evidence-based process.

Unlike standard "reviews" which can be subjective, Deep Verify uses a **Pattern Intelligence** engine and a quantitative **Evidence Score** to provide objective verdicts.

## ⚠️ Prerequisites: LLM Required

**This is NOT a standard executable.** Deep Verify is a **Prompt Engineering Workflow**.

To use it, you must have a Large Language Model (LLM) agent capable of reading files and following complex instructions, such as **Gemini CLI**, **Claude CLI**, or **Ollama** (with a capable model).

## 🚀 How to Use (Execution)

To "run" Deep Verify, instruct your LLM agent to execute the master workflow file against your target artifact.

**Command Structure:**
> "Execute the process defined in `src/core/deep-verify/workflow.md` to verify [TARGET_FILE]. [Optional: Pay special attention to X]."

**Examples:**
*   `@gemini run src/core/deep-verify/workflow.md on src/auth_service.py`
*   `@claude please verify docs/api_spec.md using the workflow in src/core/deep-verify/workflow.md.`

## 🛠️ The 6-Phase Workflow

1.  **Phase 0: Setup** — Assess stakes (Low/Med/High) and mitigate bias (Blind Mode).
2.  **Phase 1: Pattern Scan** — Rapidly identify "Red Flags" using Tier 1 methods.
3.  **Phase 2: Targeted Analysis** — Deep dives based on Phase 1 signals.
4.  **Phase 3: Adversarial Validation (MANDATORY)** — Critical attack on findings to ensure they survive scrutiny.
5.  **Phase 4: Verdict** — Final calculation of the Evidence Score (S).
6.  **Phase 5: Report** — Generation of a standardized report with actionable recommendations.

## 🧠 Core Intelligence Components

*   **Pattern Library (`data/pattern-library.yaml`):** The single source of truth for **Known Impossibilities**. Matches grant score bonuses and enable Early Exit (REJECT).
*   **Pattern Update Protocol (`data/pattern-update-protocol.yaml`):** The "Immune System" for the library. Ensures only findings grounded in theorems, definitions, or regulations become patterns.
*   **Decision Thresholds (`data/decision-thresholds.yaml`):** Defines verdict logic (e.g., `REJECT if S ≥ 6`). Configures stakes assessment and escalation triggers.
*   **Report Template (`data/report-template.md`):** Standardizes output, requiring exact quotes, score math, and explicit "not checked" sections.

## 🧰 Core Methods

*   **First Principles Analysis:** Rebuild from fundamental truths to verify core claims.
*   **Theoretical Impossibility Check:** Check claims against known theorems (CAP, FLP, Rice's).
*   **Definitional Contradiction Detector:** Find requirements that are mutually exclusive by definition.
*   **Grounding Check:** Verify if claims have explicit evidence or are ungrounded assertions.
*   **Strange Loop Detection:** Identify circular reasoning in justification graphs.
*   **Contraposition Inversion:** Invert claims to reveal unhandled failure modes.
*   **Constructive Counterexample:** Actively attempt to break a claimed property with a specific scenario.
*   **Vocabulary Consistency:** Scan for synonyms (confusion) and homonyms (contradiction).
*   **Abstraction Laddering:** Check coherence between high-level goals and implementation details.
*   **Challenge from Critical Perspective:** Adversarial "Devil's Advocate" review to find weaknesses.

## 📊 Scoring System

| Severity | Points | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CRITICAL** | `+3` | Fundamental flaw. Alone justifies REJECT. |
| **IMPORTANT** | `+1` | Significant issue. 2-3 together justify REJECT. |
| **MINOR** | `+0.3` | Style/clarity issue. |
| **Clean Pass** | `-0.5` | Method executed and found no issues. |

**Verdict:** `REJECT` if S ≥ 6 | `ACCEPT` if S ≤ -3 | `UNCERTAIN` otherwise.
