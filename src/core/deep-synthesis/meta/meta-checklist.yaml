      If achieving completeness would require a synthesis as complex as
      reality itself, accept meaningful incompleteness. Document what's
      missing and why it's acceptable.

  - id: "604"
    name: "Falsifiability Check"
    purpose: "Verify synthesis produces claims that could be proven wrong"
    reference: "Popper (1934)"
    when_to_apply:
      - "After INTEGRATE phase"
      - "For each major conclusion"

    process:
      - step: "For each conclusion: what evidence would DISPROVE it?"
      - step: "Is that evidence obtainable (in principle? practically?)?"
      - step: "If unfalsifiable: downgrade to 'perspective' or 'narrative'"
      - step: "For falsifiable: what's the cheapest/fastest way to test?"
      - step: "Set timeline for time-delayed falsification tests"

    red_flags:
      - "Conclusion has no conceivable disproof evidence"
      - "Disproof evidence is impossible to obtain"
      - "Conclusion is structured to be unfalsifiable"

    target: "At least 70% of conclusions should be falsifiable"

  - id: "605"
    name: "Source Bias Propagation Check"

        mechanism: "Dominant culture assumed universal"

      - name: "Methodological Bias"
        check: "Are multiple methods represented?"
        mechanism: "One method dominates"

    process:
      - "For each bias type: check if source set is affected"
      - "If bias detected: assess impact on synthesis conclusions"
      - "Adjust synthesis to acknowledge or correct for propagated bias"

  - id: "606"
    name: "Novel Information Test"
    purpose: "Rigorously test whether synthesis contains genuine new information"
    reference: "Shannon (1948)"
    when_to_apply:
      - "After CRYSTALLIZE phase"
      - "For each claimed insight"

    test:
      - "For each insight:"
      - "  - Is it present in Source A alone? → EXTRACTION from A"
      - "  - Is it present in Source B alone? → EXTRACTION from B"
      - "  - Does it require COMBINING A and B? → GENUINE SYNTHESIS"
      - "  - Does it come from synthesizer's knowledge? → ADDED (label it)"

    classification:
      extraction: "Present in single source (not synthesis)"
      synthesis: "Requires combining sources (genuine)"
      added: "From synthesizer's expertise, not sources (must label)"

    targets:
      minimum_novelty: "30%"
      warning: "0% novelty = this is a SUMMARY, not a synthesis"

    red_flags:
      - "All insights traceable to single sources"
      - "No emergent properties from combination"
      - "Synthesis is just reorganization of existing content"

  - id: "607"
    name: "Synthesis Decay Monitoring"
    purpose: "Define what changes would invalidate synthesis and require reassessment"
    when_to_apply:
      - "During OUTPUT phase"
      - "At synthesis completion"

    decay_triggers:
      - trigger: "New contradicting source"
        impact: "May invalidate core conclusions"
        action: "Re-evaluate affected conclusions"

      - trigger: "Source quality revision"
        impact: "Changes evidence weights"
        action: "Re-weight and potentially revise"

      - trigger: "Context change"
        impact: "May violate boundary conditions (#406)"
        action: "Check if synthesis still applies"

      - trigger: "Time passage"
        impact: "Temporal assumptions may expire"
        action: "Review time-dependent conclusions"

      - trigger: "Failed prediction"
        impact: "Synthesis model is wrong in some way"
        action: "Investigate and revise model"

      - trigger: "Paradigm shift in domain"
        impact: "May invalidate framework assumptions"
        action: "Full reassessment required"

    process:
      - "For each core conclusion: what would change it?"
      - "Set monitoring cadence: when to re-evaluate?"
      - "Define KILL criteria: what evidence would completely invalidate?"
