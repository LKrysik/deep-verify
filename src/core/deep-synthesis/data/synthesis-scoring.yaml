    - name: "Compression"
      description: "Is synthesis shorter than combined sources?"
      scale:

    - name: "Coherence"
      description: "Is synthesis internally consistent?"
      scale:
        excellent: "Internally consistent, no contradictions"
        good: "Minor tensions acknowledged"

        poor: "Contradicts itself"
      weight: 1.5

    - name: "Coverage"
      description: "Does synthesis address the synthesis question?"
      scale:
        excellent: "All aspects of question addressed"
        good: "Most addressed, gaps noted"
        adequate: "Major gaps acknowledged"
        poor: "Significant gaps unacknowledged"
      weight: 1.0

    - name: "Falsifiability"
      description: "Can synthesis conclusions be proven wrong?"
      scale:
        excellent: "All key claims falsifiable with clear tests"
        good: "Most claims falsifiable"
        adequate: "Some claims falsifiable"
        poor: "Unfalsifiable narrative"
      weight: 1.5

    - name: "Actionability"
      description: "Does synthesis lead to different action/understanding?"
      scale:
        excellent: "Clear actions for multiple stakeholders"
        good: "Clear primary action"
        adequate: "Suggestive but vague"
        poor: "No actionable implications"
      weight: 1.0

    - name: "Bias Control"
      description: "Was synthesis protected from systematic bias?"
      scale:
        excellent: "Counter-sources sought, multiple biases checked"
        good: "Some bias checks performed"
        adequate: "Minimal bias awareness"
        poor: "No bias checking"
      weight: 1.0

    - name: "Level Clarity"
      description: "Is abstraction level explicit and consistent?"
      scale:
        excellent: "Level explicit, cross-level transfers noted with caveats"
        good: "Level mostly clear"
        adequate: "Level implicit"
        poor: "Levels mixed without acknowledgment"
      weight: 0.5

# Claim type definitions
claim_types:
  - type: "Factual"
    pattern: "X is Y"
    evidence_need: "Verification"
    example: "Delta Lake supports ACID transactions"

  - type: "Causal"
    pattern: "X causes Y"
    evidence_need: "Mechanism + evidence"
    example: "Tight coupling caused the cascade failure"

  - type: "Evaluative"
    pattern: "X is better than Y"
    evidence_need: "Criteria + comparison"
    example: "Databricks is better than Synapse for this use case"

  - type: "Prescriptive"
    pattern: "You should do X"
    evidence_need: "Justification"
    example: "Always use Unity Catalog for governance"

  - type: "Predictive"
    pattern: "X will happen"
    evidence_need: "Basis + track record"
