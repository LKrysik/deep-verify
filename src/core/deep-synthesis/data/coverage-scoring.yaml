# Calculation formula
calculation: |
  C = (phases_completed × 3)
    + (methods_executed × 1)
    + (sources_processed × 0.5)
    + (claims_extracted × 0.3)
    + (relationships_mapped × 0.5)
    + (tensions_resolved × 1)
    + (emergent_insights × 1.5)
    + (mental_models × 1)
    + (principles × 1)
    + (meta_methods × 0.5)

# Quality indicators (not scored, but tracked)
quality_indicators:
  - name: "Novelty ratio"
    check: "At least 30% of insights are genuine synthesis (Shannon test PASS)"
    red_flag: "<30% novelty = this is a summary, not a synthesis"

  - name: "Compression ratio"
    check: "Synthesis is at least 2x shorter than combined sources"
    red_flag: "<2x compression = elaboration, not synthesis"

  - name: "Falsifiability coverage"
    check: "At least 70% of conclusions are falsifiable"
    red_flag: "<70% falsifiable = narrative, not knowledge"

  - name: "Diversity coverage"
    check: "At least 2/5 diversity dimensions well-represented"
    red_flag: "<2/5 diversity = high bias risk"

  - name: "Counter-source presence"
    check: "At least one dissenting source included"
    red_flag: "No counter-sources = confirmation bias risk"

  - name: "META audit complete"
    check: "All 7 META methods applied for rigorous+ depths"
    red_flag: "Missing META methods = false coherence risk"
