  # EPISTEMOLOGY — How Knowledge Is Created
  epistemology:
    - id: "E01"
      name: "Hegel's Dialectic"
      year: 1807
      principle: "Thesis + Antithesis → Synthesis"
      description: |
        The foundational model of synthesis. Contradiction is not a problem
        to eliminate — it is the ENGINE of synthesis. Sources that disagree
        are more valuable than sources that agree.
      applied_in:
        - "#302 Dialectical Tension Mapping"
        - "#401 Dialectical Integration"

    - id: "E02"
      name: "Piaget — Assimilation and Accommodation"
      year: 1952
      principle: "New knowledge either fits existing models or changes them"
      description: |
        Assimilation: Fitting new information into existing mental models.
        Accommodation: Changing mental models to fit new information.
        Synthesis requires BOTH. Error: always assimilating without accommodating.

    - id: "E03"
      name: "Bloom's Taxonomy — Revised"
      year: 2001
      authors: "Anderson & Krathwohl"
      principle: "Synthesis operates at the highest cognitive level: CREATE"
      description: |
        Remember → Understand → Apply → Analyze → Evaluate → CREATE
        Synthesis is not possible without prior analysis. The process must
        include analytical decomposition BEFORE integrative synthesis.

    - id: "E04"
      name: "Polanyi — Tacit Knowledge"
      year: 1966
      principle: "We know more than we can tell"
      description: |
        Some knowledge resists explicit articulation. Sources may contain
        tacit knowledge not captured in explicit claims. Experts may synthesize
        intuitively but can't articulate the synthesis.
      applied_in:
        - "#104 Tacit Knowledge Elicitation"

  # INFORMATION THEORY
  information_theory:
    - id: "I01"
      name: "Shannon — Information Theory"
      year: 1948
      principle: "Information = surprise. Synthesis must produce statements not in any single source."
      description: |
        A synthesis that merely repeats what sources say contains ZERO new
        information. Test: Can insight X be derived from source A alone?
        If yes, it's extraction, not synthesis.
      applied_in:
        - "#403 Emergence Detection"
        - "#606 Novel Information Test"

    - id: "I02"
      name: "Kolmogorov Complexity"
      principle: "Good synthesis is the shortest description capturing essential structure"
      description: |
        Synthesis is COMPRESSION — finding the simplest model that explains
        all the data. Anti-pattern: Synthesis longer than original sources
        has failed to compress.
      applied_in:
        - "#405 Knowledge Compression"

    - id: "I03"
      name: "Mutual Information"
      principle: "Value in what sources share vs what's unique"
      description: |
        High mutual info → sources agree → synthesis strengthens confidence.
        Low mutual info → sources cover different territory → synthesis expands.
        Negative mutual info → sources contradict → synthesis must resolve.

  # COGNITIVE SCIENCE
  cognitive_science:
    - id: "C01"
      name: "Gentner — Structure Mapping Theory"
      year: 1983
      principle: "Analogical reasoning maps STRUCTURAL relationships, not surface features"
      description: |
        Synthesis between domains requires finding structural parallels —
        shared relationship patterns even when surface details differ.
        Enables TRANSFER of solutions between domains.
      applied_in:
        - "#303 Analogical Structure Mapping"

    - id: "C02"
      name: "Fauconnier & Turner — Conceptual Blending"
      year: 2002
      principle: "Mental spaces blend to produce emergent properties"
      description: |
        Four-space model: Input 1 + Input 2 → Generic Space → Blended Space.
        The blend produces C that neither A nor B contains alone.
        This is the cognitive mechanism BEHIND synthesis.
      applied_in:
        - "#304 Conceptual Blend Construction"

    - id: "C03"
      name: "Weick — Sensemaking"
      year: 1995
      principle: "Meaning is constructed, not discovered"
      description: |
        Sensemaking is retrospective, social, grounded in identity.
        People don't DISCOVER meaning — they CONSTRUCT it.
        Synthesizer's frame shapes the synthesis (feature and bug).
      applied_in:
        - "#504 Narrative Construction"

    - id: "C04"
      name: "Peirce — Abductive Reasoning"
      year: 1903
      principle: "Inference to best explanation — creative but uncertain"
      description: |
        Deduction: certain but no new knowledge.
        Induction: probable but may be wrong.
        Abduction: creative, novel, but uncertain.
        Synthesis primarily uses ABDUCTION.

  # PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE
  philosophy_of_science:
    - id: "P01"
      name: "Kuhn — Paradigm Shifts"
      year: 1962
      principle: "Sources from different paradigms are incommensurable"
      description: |
        Same words may mean fundamentally different things across paradigms.
        Synthesis across paradigms requires TRANSLATION before integration.
      applied_in:
        - "#202 Concept Taxonomy Building"
        - "#203 Model Inventory"

    - id: "P02"
      name: "Lakatos — Research Programmes"
      year: 1978
      principle: "Hard core vs protective belt disagreements"
      description: |
        Hard core: unfalsifiable assumptions.
        Protective belt: adjustable hypotheses.
        Protective belt disagreements are easy to synthesize.
        Hard core conflicts require paradigm-level synthesis.
      applied_in:
        - "#302 Dialectical Tension Mapping"

    - id: "P03"
      name: "Feyerabend — Methodological Pluralism"
      year: 1975
      principle: "Diverse methods produce more robust synthesis"
      description: |
        No single methodology is universally best.
        Synthesis from different methodological traditions is MORE robust.
        Methodological triangulation beats single-method depth.

        - "#103 Diversity Verification"

    - id: "P04"
      name: "Popper — Falsification"
      year: 1934
      principle: "Good theory is falsifiable"
      description: |
        A synthesis that explains EVERYTHING explains NOTHING.
        Good synthesis should generate testable predictions.
        Test: What would DISPROVE this synthesis?

    - id: "R01"
      name: "Meta-Analysis"
      year: 1976
      author: "Glass"
      principle: "Weight sources by quality and sample size, not just count"
      description: |
        Statistical synthesis of multiple quantitative studies.
        Not all studies are equal — weight by quality.
        Relevant even for non-statistical synthesis.
      applied_in:

    - id: "R02"
      name: "Grounded Theory"
      year: 1967
      authors: "Glaser & Strauss"
      principle: "Let patterns EMERGE from data, don't impose them"
      description: |
        Theory emerges from systematic analysis, not from imposing
        pre-existing theory. Key method: constant comparison.

        - "#306 Pattern Detection Across Sources"

    - id: "R03"
      name: "Triangulation"
      year: 1978
      author: "Denzin"
      principle: "Cross-validate through multiple sources/methods"
      description: |
        Data triangulation, methodological triangulation, investigator
        triangulation, theory triangulation. Convergence = high confidence.

  # KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
  knowledge_management:
    - id: "K01"
      name: "SECI Model"
      year: 1995
      authors: "Nonaka & Takeuchi"
      principle: "Synthesis operates in the COMBINATION quadrant"
      description: |
        Socialization (Tacit→Tacit), Externalization (Tacit→Explicit),
        Combination (Explicit→Explicit = SYNTHESIS), Internalization.
        Deep-Synthesis operates primarily in Combination but draws on
        Externalization and should enable Internalization.
