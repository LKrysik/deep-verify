# #51 Archetype Check

**Tier:** META (Any phase)
**Purpose:** Scan for known decision traps (false dichotomy, sunk cost, etc.)

## Core Principle

Decision-making has known failure modes (archetypes). Checking for these proactively prevents common mistakes.

Reference: `data/decision-archetypes.yaml` for full list.

## What to do

At key points in exploration, run through archetype checklist:

```
ARCHETYPE CHECKLIST:

□ DA-001 FALSE DICHOTOMY
  "Do we have only 2 options? What's the third way?"
  Status: [Clear / Possible trap / Addressed]

□ DA-002 LOCAL OPTIMUM
  "Are we solving the right problem?"
  Status: [Clear / Possible trap / Addressed]

□ DA-003 SUNK COST
  "Are past investments influencing us when they shouldn't?"
  Status: [Clear / Possible trap / Addressed]

□ DA-004 AVAILABILITY BIAS
  "Are we overweighting recent/visible options?"
  Status: [Clear / Possible trap / Addressed]

□ DA-005 PREMATURE OPTIMIZATION
  "Did we explore before optimizing?"
  Status: [Clear / Possible trap / Addressed]

□ DA-006 ANALYSIS PARALYSIS
  "Are we exploring too long?"
  Status: [Clear / Possible trap / Addressed]

□ DA-007 HOBSON'S CHOICE
  "Is this a real choice or predetermined?"
  Status: [Clear / Possible trap / Addressed]

□ DA-008 BURIDAN'S ASS
  "If options seem equal, what are we missing?"
  Status: [Clear / Possible trap / Addressed]

TRAPS FOUND: [list]
MITIGATIONS APPLIED: [list]

# #52 Coverage Assessment

**Tier:** META (Any phase)
**Purpose:** Evaluate whether exploration is sufficient for decision.

## Core Principle

Coverage Score measures exploration completeness. Before converging, verify coverage is adequate.

## What to do

Calculate Coverage Score and compare to threshold:

```
COVERAGE SCORE CALCULATION:

Dimensions discovered: ___ × 2 = ___
Options enumerated: ___ × 1 = ___
Constraints mapped: ___ × 0.5 = ___
Consequences analyzed: ___ × 0.5 = ___
Risks identified: ___ × 0.5 = ___
Assumptions surfaced: ___ × 0.3 = ___
Dependencies mapped: ___ × 0.5 = ___
Blind spots found: ___ × 1 = ___

TOTAL COVERAGE SCORE: ___

THRESHOLDS:
C ≥ 20: COMPREHENSIVE - Safe to converge
10 ≤ C < 20: ADEQUATE - Can converge with noted gaps
5 ≤ C < 10: PARTIAL - Consider more exploration
C < 5: INSUFFICIENT - Do not converge yet

CURRENT STATUS: [COMPREHENSIVE / ADEQUATE / PARTIAL / INSUFFICIENT]

GAPS IDENTIFIED:
• [dimension not explored]
• [consequence not analyzed]
• [risk not considered]

RECOMMENDATION:
[ ] Proceed to convergence
[ ] Address specific gaps first: [list]
[ ] Need significantly more exploration
```

# #53 Abstraction Level Check

**Tier:** META (Any phase)
**Purpose:** Verify exploration staying at intended level - prevent scope creep.

## Core Principle

Exploration should stay at the abstraction level set in FRAME. Mixing levels causes confusion and incompletion.

## What to do

Periodically check if current discussion matches intended level:

```
INTENDED LEVEL (from FRAME): [STRATEGIC / TACTICAL / OPERATIONAL]

CURRENT DISCUSSION IS AT: [STRATEGIC / TACTICAL / OPERATIONAL]

DRIFT CHECK:
□ Are we discussing details that belong at a lower level?
□ Are we questioning fundamentals that belong at a higher level?
□ Has scope expanded beyond original decision?

IF DRIFT DETECTED:

Option 1: REFOCUS
"We're getting into [lower/higher] level details. 
 Let's stay at [intended level] for now and note 
 [drifted topic] for later exploration."

Option 2: SPLIT
"This exploration needs to happen at multiple levels.
 Let's complete [intended level] first, then do 
 separate exploration at [other level]."

Option 3: REFRAME
"The right level for this decision is actually 
 [different level]. Let's adjust our frame."

DECISION: [Refocus / Split / Reframe / Continue as-is]
```

# #54 Cynefin Reassessment

**Tier:** META (Any phase)
**Purpose:** Re-evaluate problem type as understanding deepens.

## Core Principle

Initial problem classification may be wrong. As you learn more, the problem may reveal itself as different type than assumed.

COMPLEX → COMPLICATED: "Actually, experts have solved this before"
COMPLICATED → COMPLEX: "Actually, this is more novel than we thought"
CLEAR → COMPLICATED: "Actually, this needs more analysis"

## What to do

Periodically reassess problem type:

```
INITIAL CLASSIFICATION (from FRAME): [COMPLEX / COMPLICATED / CLEAR]

CURRENT EVIDENCE:

Signs of COMPLEX:
□ Cause-effect relationships unclear
□ Experts disagree
□ No precedent exists
□ System behavior is emergent
□ Small changes have unpredictable effects
Count: ___/5

Signs of COMPLICATED:
□ Experts can analyze this
□ Similar problems have been solved
□ Best practices exist (even if not obvious)
□ Analysis reveals right answer
□ Cause-effect traceable (with effort)
Count: ___/5

Signs of CLEAR:
□ Everyone agrees on the answer
□ Standard procedure exists
□ Obvious cause-effect
□ No expertise needed
Count: ___/4

REASSESSMENT:

Initial: [type]
Current evidence suggests: [type]
Change? [Yes / No]

IF CHANGED:

From COMPLEX → COMPLICATED:
"Problem is more analyzable than thought. 
 Can rely more on expert analysis, less on experiments."

From COMPLICATED → COMPLEX:
"Problem is more novel than thought.
 Need to design experiments, not just analyze."

From Clear → Complicated/Complex:
"Problem is harder than thought.
 Need proper exploration, not just execution."

APPROACH ADJUSTMENT:
[what changes in how we explore]
```
