# M022: Black Swan Hunt

## Purpose

Find low-probability, high-impact events that could change everything.

## Core Question

```
"What unlikely event would massively change our situation?"
```

## Procedure

### 1. Hunt Positive Black Swans

```
"What unlikely good thing could happen?"

POSITIVE SWANS:
• [event] - probability: LOW - impact: [what it would enable]
• [event] - probability: LOW - impact: [what it would enable]
• [event] - probability: LOW - impact: [what it would enable]

CATEGORIES TO CHECK:
• Market: sudden demand spike, competitor failure
• Technology: breakthrough, new tool
• External: regulation in our favor, economic shift
• Social: viral moment, influential advocate
```

### 2. Hunt Negative Black Swans

```
"What unlikely bad thing could happen?"

NEGATIVE SWANS:
• [event] - probability: LOW - impact: [what it would destroy]
• [event] - probability: LOW - impact: [what it would destroy]
• [event] - probability: LOW - impact: [what it would destroy]

CATEGORIES TO CHECK:
• Market: sudden shift, giant enters
• Technology: our approach obsoleted
• External: regulation against us, economic crash
• Operational: key person leaves, security breach
```

### 3. Assess Positioning

```
POSITIVE SWANS:

For each, ask:
"Are we positioned to benefit if this happens?"
"What would we need to capture the upside?"

POSITIONING:
• [swan] → [how to be ready]

NEGATIVE SWANS:

For each, ask:
"Would this destroy us or just hurt?"
"Can we survive if this happens?"

SURVIVAL:
• [swan] → [how to survive]
```

### 4. Antifragility Check

```
"Is there an option that BENEFITS from uncertainty?"

Options that gain from volatility:
• [option] - benefits when: [what changes]

Options that suffer from volatility:
• [option] - suffers when: [what changes]
```
