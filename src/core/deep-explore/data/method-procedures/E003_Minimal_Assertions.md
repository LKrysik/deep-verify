# E003: Minimal Assertions

## Purpose

Compress knowledge to the smallest statement that still explains.

## Core Question

```
"What is the smallest true statement that captures this?"
```

## Procedure

### 1. Collect Raw Insights

```
RAW:
• [observation/insight 1]
• [observation/insight 2]
• [observation/insight 3]
```

### 2. First Compression

For each:
```
ORIGINAL: "[full statement]"
SHORTENED: "[essential only]"
LOST ANYTHING? [Y/N]
```

### 3. Find Pattern

Look across shortened statements:
```
PATTERN: "[what's common]"
```

### 4. Test Minimal Assertion

```
CANDIDATE: "[minimal assertion]"

TEST 1 - HALF:
Can you cut it in half? ___
If yes, do it and repeat.

TEST 2 - ONE WORD:
Does removing any word change meaning? ___
If no, remove that word.

TEST 3 - COUNTER-EXAMPLE:
Can you easily find an exception? ___
If yes, add condition or reject.

TEST 4 - USEFUL:
Does it help decisions? ___
If no, it's trivia not insight.
```

### 5. Express as Principle

```
STRUCTURE: [Condition] → [Consequence]

EXAMPLE: "Complexity → maintenance cost"
```

## Output

```
MINIMAL ASSERTIONS:
1. "[assertion]" - useful for: ___
2. "[assertion]" - useful for: ___

MENTAL MODEL:
"[one sentence essence]"
```
