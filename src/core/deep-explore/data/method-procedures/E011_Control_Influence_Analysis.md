# E011: Control vs Influence Analysis

## Purpose

Separate what you can change from what you can't. Fear often targets the uncontrollable.

## Core Question

```
"Is what I'm afraid of inside or outside my zone of control?"
```

## Why This Matters

Most fear is about uncontrollable things.
But you can only act on controllable things.

Mixing them creates paralysis.
Separating them creates clarity.

## Procedure

### 1. List All Concerns

```
EVERYTHING I'M WORRIED ABOUT:
1. [concern]
2. [concern]
3. [concern]
4. [concern]
5. [concern]
...
```

### 2. Classify by Control

```
THREE ZONES:

CONTROL (I can directly change):
Things where my action directly determines outcome.
• [concern] - I can: [specific action]

INFLUENCE (I can affect but not control):
Things where my action affects probability but doesn't guarantee.
• [concern] - I can increase odds by: [action]

NO CONTROL (outside my power):
Things that happen regardless of what I do.
• [concern] - I cannot affect this because: [reason]
```

### 3. Design Response by Zone

```
FOR CONTROLLABLE:
→ Design specific action
→ Execute action
→ Measure result

FOR INFLUENCEABLE:
→ Identify highest-leverage action
→ Do what you can
→ Accept uncertainty on outcome

FOR UNCONTROLLABLE:
→ Accept or ignore
→ Do NOT spend energy worrying
→ Design contingency IF it happens
```

### 4. Redirect Energy

```
ENERGY AUDIT:

Where am I spending mental energy?
• [zone] - [%] of worry

Where SHOULD I spend energy?
• CONTROL zone: [%]
• INFLUENCE zone: [%]
• NO CONTROL zone: 0%

REDIRECT:
Stop worrying about: [uncontrollable items]
Start acting on: [controllable items]
```

## The Stoic Filter

```
ANCIENT WISDOM (Epictetus):

"Some things are within our power, while others are not.
Within our power are opinion, motivation, desire, aversion...
Not within our power are our body, our property, reputation, office..."

MODERN APPLICATION:

What others think → NO CONTROL
What I say/do → CONTROL
Market conditions → NO CONTROL (maybe INFLUENCE)
My product quality → CONTROL
Whether people buy → INFLUENCE
How I respond to rejection → CONTROL
```

## Output

```
CONTROL vs INFLUENCE ANALYSIS

CONCERNS ANALYZED: [count]

ZONE CLASSIFICATION:
┌────────────────────────────┬────────────┬────────────────────┐
│ Concern                    │ Zone       │ Response           │
├────────────────────────────┼────────────┼────────────────────┤
│ [concern 1]                │ CONTROL    │ [action]           │
│ [concern 2]                │ INFLUENCE  │ [best effort]      │
│ [concern 3]                │ NO CONTROL │ [accept/contingency│
└────────────────────────────┴────────────┴────────────────────┘

ENERGY REDIRECT:
• Stop: [what to stop worrying about]
• Start: [what to start doing]

ACTIONABLE ITEMS: [list of things in CONTROL zone]
```

## Integration

Use in: Step 0 (to filter real concerns), Step 4 (to focus challenge)
