# E014: Growth Test

## Purpose

Filter decisions by whether they develop you. Risk is worthwhile when it builds capability.

## Core Question

```
"Will attempting this force me to learn something new?"
```

## Why This Matters

Two types of risk:
1. **Gambling** - outcome uncertain, you learn nothing either way
2. **Investment** - outcome uncertain, but you grow regardless

Growth test distinguishes them.

Key insight:
- If YES (you grow) → exploration worthwhile even if "fails"
- If NO (no growth) → just gambling or repeating known

---

## Procedure

### 1. Identify the Action

```
ACTION UNDER CONSIDERATION:
"I'm thinking about [doing X]"
```

### 2. Apply Growth Test

```
GROWTH TEST:

□ Will this FORCE me to learn something new? [Y/N]
  What: ___

□ Will this develop a SKILL I don't have? [Y/N]
  Which skill: ___

□ Will this give me EXPERIENCE I lack? [Y/N]
  What experience: ___

□ Will this expand my NETWORK or access? [Y/N]
  How: ___

□ Will this change how I THINK about something? [Y/N]
  What: ___

GROWTH COUNT: [___/5]
```

### 3. Assess Growth Value

```
IF GROWTH COUNT > 0:

WHAT I'LL LEARN:
• [skill/knowledge/experience]
• [skill/knowledge/experience]

VALUE OF LEARNING:
Is this learning valuable beyond this specific attempt?
• Yes: [how it transfers]
• No: [why not]

IF GROWTH COUNT = 0:

This is pure gambling:
• Win → got lucky
• Lose → lost resources, learned nothing

RECONSIDER: Is there a version that includes growth?
```

### 4. Design for Maximum Learning

```
HOW TO MAXIMIZE GROWTH:

Even if main goal fails, ensure:
□ I document what I learn
□ I try approaches I haven't before
□ I push into uncomfortable territory
□ I get feedback I can learn from

LEARNING GOALS (independent of outcome):
1. [what to learn regardless]
2. [what to learn regardless]
```

### 5. Make Decision

```
DECISION FRAMEWORK:

HIGH GROWTH + ACCEPTABLE RISK → DO IT
• Valuable even if "fails"

LOW GROWTH + HIGH RISK → DON'T
• Pure gambling

LOW GROWTH + LOW RISK → CONSIDER
• May not be worth the time

HIGH GROWTH + HIGH RISK → DESIGN SAFER VERSION
• Keep learning, reduce downside
```

## Growth Categories

```
SKILL GROWTH:
• Technical skills
• People skills
• Creative skills
• Decision-making

KNOWLEDGE GROWTH:
• Domain knowledge
• Market knowledge
• Self-knowledge
• Pattern recognition

EXPERIENCE GROWTH:
• Types of situations handled
• Failures survived
• Successes achieved
• Relationships built

CAPABILITY GROWTH:
• Things you can now do
• Resources you can now access
• Credibility you now have
```

## Output

```
GROWTH TEST

Action: "[what you're considering]"

GROWTH ASSESSMENT:
┌────────────────────────────┬────────┬────────────────────┐
│ Growth Type                │ Y/N    │ What specifically  │
├────────────────────────────┼────────┼────────────────────┤
│ New learning forced        │        │                    │
│ New skill developed        │        │                    │
│ New experience gained      │        │                    │
│ Network/access expanded    │        │                    │
│ Thinking changed           │        │                    │
└────────────────────────────┴────────┴────────────────────┘

GROWTH SCORE: [___/5]

IF FAILS, I STILL GET:
• [learning 1]
• [learning 2]

VERDICT:
[ ] HIGH GROWTH - worth doing
[ ] GAMBLING - reconsider
[ ] NEEDS REDESIGN - add learning component
```

## Integration

Use in: Step 0 (to filter what's worth exploring), Step 5 (to evaluate options)
