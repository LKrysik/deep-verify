# E007: Information Questions

## Purpose

Identify the highest-value questions - what information would most change decisions.

## Core Questions

```
1. "What information would change my decision the most?"
2. "What do I not know but assume I know?"
3. "What is everyone ignoring because it seems obvious?"
```

## Procedure

### 1. Decision-Changing Information

```
CURRENT LEANING: [what you're inclined to decide]

QUESTION: "What single piece of information would make me
          change from [current] to [opposite]?"

HIGH-VALUE QUESTIONS:
• [question 1] - if answer is X, I'd change to ___
• [question 2] - if answer is X, I'd change to ___
```

### 2. Assumed Knowledge

```
"What am I treating as KNOWN that I haven't verified?"

AUDIT:
• [thing treated as fact] - actually verified? [Y/N]
• [thing treated as fact] - actually verified? [Y/N]

HIDDEN UNKNOWNS:
• [what I assumed I knew but don't]
```

### 3. Obvious Blindspots

```
"What is so obvious that no one questions it?"

OBVIOUS ASSUMPTIONS:
• [assumption 1] - but what if wrong?
• [assumption 2] - but what if wrong?

OVERLOOKED:
• [what becomes visible when we question obvious]
```

### 4. Value of Information

For each question:
```
QUESTION: [what we want to know]

VALUE: How much would knowing this change things?
[ ] HIGH - would change decision
[ ] MED - would change confidence
[ ] LOW - nice to know

COST: How hard to find out?
[ ] EASY - quick research
[ ] MEDIUM - significant effort
[ ] HARD - may not be knowable

PRIORITY: VALUE / COST
```

## Output

```
HIGHEST-VALUE QUESTIONS:
1. [question] - priority: HIGH
   If answer is ___, then ___

2. [question] - priority: HIGH
   If answer is ___, then ___

HIDDEN UNKNOWNS DISCOVERED:
• [what we thought we knew but don't]

QUESTIONED OBVIOUS:
• [assumption worth challenging]

RECOMMENDED:
