# M011: Consequence Analysis

## Purpose

Map what happens if you choose each option. Mark VERIFIED vs ASSUMED.

## Core Question

```
"If we choose [X], what happens?"
```

## Procedure

### 1. Select Options to Analyze

```
Analyze:
• Top 2-3 most likely options
• Any option with unclear consequences
```

### 2. Map Immediate Consequences

```
OPTION: [description]

GAINS (what you get):
• [gain] - [VERIFIED/ASSUMED] - source: ___

COSTS (what you pay):
• [cost] - [VERIFIED/ASSUMED] - source: ___

RISKS (what could go wrong):
• [risk] - probability: [HIGH/MED/LOW] - [VERIFIED/ASSUMED]
```

### 3. Map Downstream Consequences

```
OPENS (future possibilities enabled):
• [possibility] - [VERIFIED/ASSUMED]

CLOSES (future possibilities foreclosed):
• [possibility] - [VERIFIED/ASSUMED]

REQUIRES (next steps needed):
• [requirement] - [VERIFIED/ASSUMED]
```

### 4. Verification Check

```
For each ASSUMED consequence:

Is this assumption CRITICAL to the option's value?
[ ] YES → Must verify (return to Step 1)
[ ] NO → Can proceed with noted uncertainty
```

## Output

```
OPTION: [name]

IMMEDIATE:
├── Gain: [what] - [V/A]
├── Cost: [what] - [V/A]
└── Risk: [what] - [V/A]

DOWNSTREAM:
├── Opens: [what] - [V/A]
├── Closes: [what] - [V/A]
└── Requires: [what] - [V/A]

VERIFICATION STATUS:
• Verified: [count]
• Assumed: [count] (critical: [count])
```
