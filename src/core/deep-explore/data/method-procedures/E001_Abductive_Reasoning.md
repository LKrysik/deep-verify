# E001: Abductive Reasoning

## Purpose

Generate new hypotheses from observations. This is the ONLY type of reasoning that creates new possibilities.

## Core Question

```
"I observe [B]. What [A] could explain this?"
```

## Procedure

### 1. Identify the Explanandum

```
EXPLANANDUM: [what needs explaining]
"I want to explain why/how: ___________________________"
```

### 2. Generate Hypotheses

Use multiple lenses:

```
MECHANISTIC: "What mechanism could cause this?"
FUNCTIONAL:  "What purpose could this serve?"
HISTORICAL:  "How could this have come about?"
STRUCTURAL:  "What structure enables this?"
```

For each lens, generate 2-3 hypotheses:

```
HYPOTHESIS 1: [explanation]
HYPOTHESIS 2: [explanation]
HYPOTHESIS 3: [explanation]
```

### 3. Evaluate Hypotheses

For each hypothesis:

```
FALSIFIABLE?  [Y/N] - How would you disprove it?
FERTILE?      [Y/N] - Does it open new questions?
SIMPLE?       [Y/N] - Is it parsimonious?
CONSISTENT?   [Y/N] - Does it fit known facts?
```

### 4. Rank and Select

```
BEST HYPOTHESIS: [which and why]
TEST: [how to confirm/refute]
```

## Output

```
EXPLANANDUM: ___
HYPOTHESES:
1. [H1] - test: ___
2. [H2] - test: ___
3. [H3] - test: ___

BEST: [which] because [why]
IMPLICATIONS: [what this opens up]
```
