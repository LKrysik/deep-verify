# E010: Cognitive MVP (Minimal Viable Probe)

## Purpose

Find the smallest action that teaches you something. Reframe failure as data.

## Core Question

```
"What is the smallest thing I can do that will TEACH me something?"
```

## Why This Matters

Wrong question: "How do I do this right?"
Right question: "How do I learn if this is worth doing?"

Key insight:
- If action gives NO new information → bad exploration
- If action gives information → success, even when it "fails"

This transforms:
- Failure → Data
- Risk → Cost of information

## Procedure

### 1. Identify the Uncertainty

```
WHAT I DON'T KNOW:
"I'm uncertain whether [X] because [Y]"

EXAMPLE:
"I'm uncertain whether customers want this because I haven't asked any"
```

### 2. Design Minimal Probe

```
"What's the SMALLEST action that would reduce this uncertainty?"

PROBE OPTIONS:
• [action 1] - effort: [LOW/MED/HIGH] - learning: [what it teaches]
• [action 2] - effort: [LOW/MED/HIGH] - learning: [what it teaches]
• [action 3] - effort: [LOW/MED/HIGH] - learning: [what it teaches]

SELECTED PROBE:
[lowest effort that teaches something meaningful]
```

### 3. Define Learning Outcomes

```
BEFORE PROBE:
What do I believe? [current assumption]
Confidence: [%]

AFTER PROBE:
If result is A → I learn: ___
If result is B → I learn: ___
If result is C → I learn: ___

SUCCESS CRITERION:
Probe succeeds if I learn ANYTHING, regardless of outcome.
```

### 4. Execute and Extract Learning

```
PROBE RESULT: [what happened]

WHAT I LEARNED:
• [insight 1]
• [insight 2]

WHAT CHANGES:
• My belief changed from ___ to ___
• My confidence changed from ___% to ___%
• Next question to probe: ___
```

## Reframing Risk

```
TRADITIONAL VIEW:
"If I try X and it fails, I lose [time/money/reputation]"

MVP VIEW:
"If I try MINIMAL X and it 'fails', I gain [knowledge] for [minimal cost]"

CALCULATION:
Cost of probe: [small]
Value of information: [eliminates uncertainty about Y]
ROI: Usually positive
```

---

## Examples

```
UNCERTAINTY: "I don't know if people will pay for this"

BAD APPROACH: Build full product, launch, see if sales
GOOD PROBE: Ask 10 potential customers if they'd pay $X

PROBE RESULT: 8/10 said no
LEARNING: Price is wrong OR value prop unclear OR wrong audience
NEXT PROBE: Test different price / different message / different audience
```

---

## Output

```
COGNITIVE MVP

Uncertainty: "[what I don't know]"

PROBE:
Action: [minimal action]
Effort: [LOW/MED/HIGH]
Time: [estimate]

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
• If A → learn: ___
• If B → learn: ___
• If C → learn: ___

RESULT: [what happened]

LEARNING EXTRACTED:
• [key insight]
• Next probe: [what to test next]

INFORMATION VALUE: [was it worth it?]
```
