# E009: Reverse Abduction

## Purpose

Discover paths by assuming success and working backwards. This breaks "impossible" thinking.

## Core Question

```
"ASSUMING this works - what conditions must be true?"
```

## Why This Matters

Normal thinking: "Can I do this?" → usually stops at first obstacle

Reverse abduction: "If I did it, how?" → reveals multiple possible paths

Key insight: You don't need ALL conditions - often ONE sufficient path is enough.

---

## Procedure

### 1. Assume Success

```
ASSUMPTION: "It worked. [Goal] was achieved."

Don't question IF. Just accept it happened.
```

### 2. List Necessary Conditions

```
"For this to have worked, what must have been true?"

CONDITIONS:
1. [condition that must be true]
2. [condition that must be true]
3. [condition that must be true]
4. [condition that must be true]
5. [condition that must be true]
...

Be thorough. List everything.
```

### 3. Classify Conditions

```
NECESSARY (must have ALL):
These conditions must ALL be true for success.
• [condition]

SUFFICIENT (need ONE):
Any ONE of these would be enough.
• [condition] OR
• [condition] OR
• [condition]

HELPFUL (but not required):
Nice to have but success possible without.
• [condition]
```

### 4. Find Alternative Paths

```
If condition X is hard, is there alternative path?

CONDITION: [hard condition]
ALTERNATIVES:
• Instead of X, could do Y because: ___
• Instead of X, could use Z because: ___
• X is actually not necessary if: ___
```

### 5. Discover Minimal Viable Path

```
MINIMAL PATH (fewest conditions needed):

To succeed, I need:
1. [essential condition]
2. [essential condition]
3. [essential condition]

Everything else is optional.
```

## Breaking "Impossible" Thinking

```
CLAIM: "This is impossible"

REVERSE ABDUCTION:
"If it WERE possible, what would be true?"

RESULT:
Often reveals that:
• Only 1-2 conditions are actually blocking
• There are paths you hadn't considered
• "Impossible" was "I don't see how" not "cannot be done"
```

---

## Output

```
REVERSE ABDUCTION

Goal: "[what you want to achieve]"

ASSUMING SUCCESS, CONDITIONS NEEDED:
┌────────────────────────────┬────────────┬────────────────────┐
│ Condition                  │ Type       │ Status             │
├────────────────────────────┼────────────┼────────────────────┤
│ [condition 1]              │ NECESSARY  │ [have/need]        │
│ [condition 2]              │ SUFFICIENT │ [have/need]        │
│ [condition 3]              │ HELPFUL    │ [have/need]        │
└────────────────────────────┴────────────┴────────────────────┘

ALTERNATIVE PATHS DISCOVERED:
• Path A: [conditions needed]
• Path B: [conditions needed]
• Path C: [conditions needed]

MINIMAL VIABLE PATH:
[fewest conditions for success]

BLOCKING: [what's actually blocking]
NOT BLOCKING: [what seemed blocking but isn't]
```

## Integration

Use in: Step 0 (to break "impossible"), Step 2 (to find options)
