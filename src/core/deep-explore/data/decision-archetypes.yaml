# Decision Archetypes

Common patterns in decision spaces that often lead to suboptimal outcomes.
Use to check if your exploration has fallen into a known trap.

---

## DA-001: False Dichotomy

**Pattern:** Only 2 options presented when more exist.

**Signals:**
- "Should we do A or B?"
- "The choice is between X and Y"
- "Either we [option1] or we [option2]"

**Reality:**
- There's almost always a third (or fourth, or fifth) option
- Often C = hybrid of A and B
- Often D = reframe that makes A/B irrelevant

**Check:** 
"Have we found at least 4 options? If only 2, what's the third way?"

**Examples:**
- "Build or buy?" → Also: partner, acquire, open-source, hybrid
- "Python or Java?" → Also: Go, Rust, TypeScript, multiple languages

---

## DA-002: Local Optimum Trap

**Pattern:** Best option within current frame, but frame is wrong.

**Signals:**
- Quick consensus on "obviously best" option
- No consideration of whether question is right
- Optimization of details before validating direction

**Reality:**
- Best answer to wrong question is still wrong
- Reframing often reveals better options entirely
- "Best database" irrelevant if you shouldn't use a database

**Check:**
"Are we solving the right problem? What if we stepped back one level?"

**Examples:**
- "Best email marketing tool" when you should question email marketing
- "Fastest algorithm" when you should question if computation is needed

---

## DA-003: Sunk Cost Anchor

**Pattern:** Past investments influence decision when they shouldn't.

**Signals:**
- "We've already invested X in this approach"
- "We can't abandon Y after all that work"
- "The team learned Z, we should use it"

**Reality:**
- Past costs are gone regardless of decision
- Only future costs and benefits matter
- Skills/investments that don't serve future are liabilities

**Check:**
"If we started fresh today with no history, what would we choose?"

**Examples:**
- Continuing with bad vendor because of integration effort
- Keeping legacy system because of rewrite cost (ignoring ongoing maintenance)

---

## DA-004: Availability Heuristic

**Pattern:** Recent or vivid options dominate consideration.

**Signals:**
- Option chosen because "everyone is using it"
- Recent conference talk influenced choice
- Competitor's visible choice drives yours

**Reality:**
- Popular ≠ right for you
- Visible ≠ most common
- Recent ≠ proven

**Check:**
"Are we overweighting options we've heard about recently? What options existed 5 years ago that are still valid?"

**Examples:**
- Choosing Kubernetes because of hype when simpler works
- Selecting AI solution because of news coverage

---

## DA-005: Premature Optimization

**Pattern:** Optimizing before understanding.

**Signals:**
- Deep analysis of option details before exploring option space
- "Let me explain why A is better than B" before finding C, D, E
- Convergence before divergence complete

**Reality:**
- Can't optimize if you haven't explored
- Deep optimization of wrong option = waste
- Explore before exploit

**Check:**
"Have we completed Phase 1 (MAP) before diving into details? Is Coverage Score adequate?"

**Examples:**
- Optimizing database schema before validating data model
- A/B testing button colors before validating product-market fit

---

## DA-006: Analysis Paralysis

**Pattern:** Endless exploration, never converging.

**Signals:**
- Coverage Score keeps growing but decision not made
- "We need to explore one more option"
- Fear of closing options

**Reality:**
- Decision has cost, but so does delay
- Perfect information never available
- At some point, must decide with uncertainty

**Check:**
"Is additional exploration providing proportional value? Have we set decision criteria upfront?"

**Mitigation:**
- Set exploration time limit before starting
- Define "good enough" Coverage Score
- Remember: reversible decisions can be made faster

---

## DA-007: Hobson's Choice

**Pattern:** Fake choice where only one real option exists.

**Signals:**
- All other options quickly eliminated by "constraints"
- Single vendor/approach presented as "only one that works"
- Options that no reasonable person would choose listed for completeness

**Reality:**
- If there's truly only one option, you don't need Deep Explore
- More often, constraints are artificial
- Single-option scenarios should be challenged hard

**Check:**
"Are the 'constraints' that eliminate options truly hard? Who benefits from this being a single-option situation?"

**Examples:**
- Vendor claims only their solution meets requirements
- Internal champion pre-eliminates competitors

---

## DA-008: Buridan's Ass

**Pattern:** Options appear equal, decision paralyzed.

**Signals:**
- "Both options seem about the same"
- Long deliberation between similar choices
- Coin-flip considered

**Reality:**
- They're probably not equal - you haven't found the difference
- Even if equal, decide fast (opportunity cost of delay)
- If truly equal, either is fine - pick and move on

**Check:**
"What criteria would reveal a difference? If truly equal, what's the cost of delay vs. picking one?"

**Examples:**
- Choosing between two similar cloud providers
- Selecting between comparable candidates

---

## DA-009: Optimism Bias

**Pattern:** Best-case assumptions throughout.

**Signals:**
- All estimates are "if everything goes well"
- Risks mentioned but discounted
- "We're better than average" assumption

**Reality:**
- Things usually don't go well
- Your project is probably not exceptional
- Premortem finds the optimism hiding

**Check:**
"Have we run Premortem (#21)? What would a pessimist say about our assumptions?"

---

## DA-010: Groupthink Convergence

**Pattern:** Social pressure toward consensus hides valid options.

**Signals:**
- Quick agreement without dissent
- "Everyone thinks X is best"
- Minority views not explored

**Reality:**
- Disagreement often indicates unexplored territory
- Consensus can be pressure, not correctness
- Devil's advocate reveals hidden options

**Check:**
"What would someone who disagrees say? Why might the minority view be right?"

---

## DA-011: Authority Anchor

**Pattern:** Expert or leader opinion accepted without exploration.

**Signals:**
- "The CTO said we should use X"
- "Industry experts recommend Y"
- Exploration skipped because authority decided

**Reality:**
- Experts can be wrong
- Their context may differ from yours
- Authority opinion is input, not conclusion

**Check:**
"If the authority was wrong, how would we know? What's their evidence?"

---

## DA-012: Scope Creep Drift

**Pattern:** Abstraction level shifts during exploration.

**Signals:**
- Started strategic, now discussing implementation details
- Started with one decision, now exploring three
- Dimensions keep multiplying

**Reality:**
- Different levels need different explorations
- Mixing levels creates confusion
- Scope discipline enables completion

**Check:**
"Are we still at the abstraction level we set in Frame? If scope has grown, should we split into multiple explorations?"

---

## How to Use Archetypes

### During Exploration

After each phase, quick-check:

```
□ DA-001: Do we have >2 options per dimension?
□ DA-002: Are we sure we're solving the right problem?
□ DA-003: Are past investments influencing us?
□ DA-004: Are we overweighting recent/visible options?
□ DA-005: Did we explore before optimizing?
□ DA-006: Are we exploring too long?
□ DA-007: Is this a real choice or predetermined?
□ DA-008: If options seem equal, what are we missing?
□ DA-009: Have we stress-tested with premortem?
□ DA-010: Is there suppressed disagreement?
□ DA-011: Are we deferring to authority without evidence?
□ DA-012: Has scope drifted from original frame?
```

### When Archetype Detected

1. **Name it:** "We might be in False Dichotomy"
2. **Evidence:** "Because we only have 2 options listed"
3. **Apply check:** "Let's generate third option before proceeding"
4. **Document:** Note in exploration record

## Coverage Score Adjustments

When archetype is detected and addressed:

| Archetype Found & Addressed | Points |
|-----------------------------|--------|
| False Dichotomy → found new options | +1 per new option |
| Local Optimum → reframed problem | +2 |
| Sunk Cost → removed from consideration | +0.5 |
| Hobson's Choice → challenged constraints | +1 per option recovered |
| Scope Creep → refocused | No points, but enables completion |
