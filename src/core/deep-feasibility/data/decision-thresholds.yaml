decision_matrix:
  description: |
    Decision is determined by TWO factors:
    1. Binding constraint score (1-5)
    2. Confidence level on that score (H/M/L)

    Same score with different confidence = different decision.

  cells:
    - score_range: [4, 5]
      score_label: "Feasible"
      confidence: "High"
      decision: "GO"
      meaning: "Proceed with standard project management"
      next_steps:
        - "Initiate project"
        - "Standard risk monitoring"
        - "Scheduled reassessments at milestones"

    - score_range: [4, 5]
      score_label: "Feasible"
      confidence: "Low"
      decision: "CONDITIONAL GO"
      meaning: "Proceed but invest in validation"
      next_steps:
        - "Design validation activities first"
        - "Run probes/spikes before full commitment"
        - "Gate decision after validation"

    - score_range: [3, 3]
      score_label: "Borderline"
      confidence: "High"
      decision: "CONDITIONAL GO"
      meaning: "Proceed with explicit conditions and checkpoints"
      next_steps:
        - "Document all conditions explicitly"
        - "Define checkpoint criteria"
        - "Plan fallbacks for each condition"

    - score_range: [3, 3]
      score_label: "Borderline"
      confidence: "Low"
      decision: "INVESTIGATE"
      meaning: "More information needed before deciding"
      next_steps:
        - "Identify what information would change decision"
        - "Design investigation activities"
        - "Set decision deadline"

    - score_range: [1, 2]
      score_label: "Infeasible"
      confidence: "High"
      decision: "NO GO"
      meaning: "Stop, redirect, or fundamentally redesign"
      next_steps:
        - "Document why infeasible"
        - "Identify what would make it feasible"
        - "Propose alternatives"

    - score_range: [1, 2]
      score_label: "Infeasible"
      confidence: "Low"
      decision: "INVESTIGATE or NO GO"
      meaning: "May be infeasible, may be unknown"
      next_steps:
        - "Determine if investigation can resolve uncertainty"
        - "If investigation not feasible → NO GO"
        - "If investigation feasible → investigate then decide"

decision_types:
  GO:
    description: "Proceed with standard project management"
    implies:
      - "Binding constraint score ≥ 4 with high confidence"
      - "Conditions are few and manageable"
      - "Risk profile acceptable"
    monitoring:
      - "Standard project metrics"
      - "Decay trigger monitoring"
      - "Scheduled reassessments"

  NO_GO:
    description: "Stop current approach"
    implies:
      - "Binding constraint score ≤ 2 with high confidence"
      - "Fundamental barrier exists"
      - "Effort would be wasted"
    options:
      redesign: "What would make it feasible?"
      reduce_scope: "What could be cut?"
      extend_timeline: "By how much?"
      increase_resources: "What's needed?"
      abandon: "Is this the wrong goal entirely?"

  CONDITIONAL_GO:
    description: "Proceed only after conditions secured"
    implies:
      - "Feasibility depends on external factors"
      - "Conditions are enumerable and monitorable"
      - "Fallbacks exist for condition failure"
    requirements:
      - "All conditions explicitly documented"
      - "Probability assigned to each condition"
      - "Fallback plan for each condition"
      - "Monitoring mechanism for each condition"
      - "Compound probability calculated"

  INVESTIGATE:
    description: "More information needed before deciding"
    implies:
      - "Key uncertainty exists"
      - "Investigation can resolve uncertainty"
      - "Cost of investigation < cost of wrong decision"
    requirements:
      - "Specific questions to answer"
      - "Method to answer each question"
      - "Timeline for investigation"
      - "Decision deadline"

conditional_logic:
  compound_probability:
    description: |
      Multiple independent conditions compound as:
      P(all conditions) = P(C1) × P(C2) × ... × P(Cn)

      Example:
      5 conditions, each P=0.8
      Compound: 0.8^5 = 0.33 (33%)

      Many "likely" conditions → "unlikely" combined feasibility

    thresholds:
      high: "> 0.6"
      medium: "0.3 - 0.6"
      low: "< 0.3"

  condition_attributes:
    - name: "probability"
      question: "How likely is this condition to hold?"
      values: ["High (>80%)", "Medium (50-80%)", "Low (<50%)", "Unknown"]

    - name: "controller"
      question: "Who controls whether this condition holds?"
      values: ["Us", "Partner", "External", "Regulation", "Market"]

    - name: "fallback"
      question: "What's the plan if this condition fails?"
      values: ["Documented fallback", "Partial mitigation", "Accept delay", "Project fails"]

    - name: "monitoring"
      question: "How will we know if this condition is failing?"
      values: ["Early warning system", "Regular check", "Reactive only"]

escalation_triggers:
  description: "When to escalate beyond normal decision process"

  triggers:
    - condition: "Non-ergodic risk identified"
      meaning: "Survival uncertain if risk materializes"
      action: "Escalate to executive/board level"

    - condition: "Regulatory prohibition discovered"
      meaning: "H5 constraint — cannot proceed legally"
      action: "Escalate to legal/compliance"

    - condition: "Compound probability < 0.2"
      meaning: "Very unlikely all conditions hold"
      action: "Escalate to sponsor — is this worth pursuing?"

    - condition: "Dunning-Kruger zone on binding constraint"
      meaning: "Score unreliable due to low expertise"
      action: "Require external expert validation"

reassessment_rules:
  boehm_spiral:
    description: "Feasibility is not one-time; reassess at milestones"

      - milestone: "Sprint boundary"
        scope: "Quick check on binding constraint"

# USAGE SUMMARY:
#
# 1. Take binding constraint score (1-5)
# 2. Assess confidence on binding constraint (H/M/L)
# 3. Look up in decision_matrix
# 4. If CONDITIONAL: apply conditional_logic
# 5. Check for escalation_triggers
# 6. Document decision with rationale
