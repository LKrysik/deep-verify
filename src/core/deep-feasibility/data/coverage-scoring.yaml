coverage_calculation:
  formula: |
    C = (phases × 3) + (methods × 1) + (dimensions × 1) +
        (constraints × 0.5) + (conditions × 0.5) +
        (assumptions_tested × 1) + (probes × 1.5) + (meta_methods × 0.5)

  example:
    phases_completed: 5
    methods_executed: 20
    dimensions_scored: 10
    constraints_classified: 8
    conditions_mapped: 5
    assumptions_tested: 3
    probes_designed: 2
    meta_methods_applied: 4

    calculation: |
      C = (5 × 3) + (20 × 1) + (10 × 1) + (8 × 0.5) + (5 × 0.5) +
          (3 × 1) + (2 × 1.5) + (4 × 0.5)
      C = 15 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 2.5 + 3 + 3 + 2
      C = 59.5

quality_indicators:
  red_flags:
    - condition: "Coverage < depth threshold"
      meaning: "Assessment may be incomplete"
    - condition: "No constraints identified"
      meaning: "Possible blind spot — constraints always exist"
    - condition: "All dimensions ≥ 4"
      meaning: "Possible optimism bias — check against reference class"
    - condition: "No conditions mapped for CONDITIONAL GO"
      meaning: "Conditions not explicit — cannot monitor"
    - condition: "META methods skipped"
      meaning: "Bias not checked — planning fallacy likely"

  good_signs:
    - condition: "Coverage exceeds threshold"
      meaning: "Thorough assessment"
    - condition: "Both H5 and H0 constraints found"
      meaning: "Full spectrum considered"
    - condition: "Dimensions have mixed scores"
      meaning: "Calibrated, not uniformly optimistic"
    - condition: "Reference class used"
      meaning: "Debiased estimates"
    - condition: "DK zones acknowledged"

# USAGE SUMMARY:
#
# 1. Count completed activities in each category
# 2. Multiply by points
# 3. Sum total coverage score (C)
# 4. Compare to depth-appropriate threshold
# 5. Document in report:
#    - C value
#    - Threshold comparison
#    - Coverage label (comprehensive/adequate/partial/insufficient)
