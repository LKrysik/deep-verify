# Phase 4: DECIDE

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES

1. **BINDING CONSTRAINT DETERMINES DECISION** — min(dimensions), not average
2. **CONFIDENCE MATTERS** — Same score with different confidence = different decision
3. **CONDITIONS EXPLICIT** — "Feasible IF" must enumerate ALL conditions
4. **DECAY IS DESIGNED** — Feasibility changes; monitoring is mandatory

## 4.1 Multi-Axis Feasibility Profile (#401)

**Load:** `data/method-procedures/401_Multi_Axis_Feasibility_Profile.md`

**Purpose:** Aggregate all 10 dimensions into a visual profile showing feasibility shape.

### Generate Visual Profile

```
FEASIBILITY PROFILE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Technical     ████████░░  4  H    Proven technology, TRL 8-9
Resource      ██████░░░░  3  M    Gap in headcount, closable
Knowledge     ████████░░  4  M    Strong tech, domain gap
Organization  ██████░░░░  3  L    Cross-team coordination needed

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
BINDING CONSTRAINT: Temporal (score: 2)
OVERALL FEASIBILITY: 2 (Doubtful)
CONFIDENCE PROFILE: Mixed (4H, 4M, 2L)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Profile Analysis

1. **Identify binding constraint** (lowest score)
2. **Assess constraint addressability:**
   - What would raise it by 1 point?
   - What's the cost?
   - Does improving it worsen another dimension?

3. **Check for low-confidence scores:**
   - Low confidence on binding constraint = investigate before deciding
   - Low confidence on high score = may be overestimated

### Record Profile

```yaml
feasibility_profile:
  dimensions:
    technical: {score: 4, confidence: "H", note: "Proven tech"}
    resource: {score: 3, confidence: "M", note: "Gap closable"}
    knowledge: {score: 4, confidence: "M", note: "Domain gap exists"}
    organizational: {score: 3, confidence: "L", note: "Coordination risk"}
    temporal: {score: 2, confidence: "H", note: "Critical path issue"}
    compositional: {score: 3, confidence: "M", note: "35% integration"}

  improvement_path: "Extend deadline 3 weeks OR reduce scope by 20%"
```

## 4.2 Confidence-Weighted Decision (#402)

**Load:** `data/method-procedures/402_Confidence_Weighted_Decision.md`

**Purpose:** Combine feasibility score with CONFIDENCE. Score of 4 with high confidence ≠ Score of 4 with low confidence.

### Decision Matrix

### Confidence Assessment

| Level | Basis | Reliability |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **High** | Empirical evidence — probes, spikes, reference class, measurements | Strong |
| **Medium** | Expert judgment (calibrated), analogies with verified transfer | Moderate |
| **Low** | Team gut feeling, planning estimates (uncalibrated), assumptions | Weak |

### Apply Decision Logic

```
1. Take binding constraint score
2. Assess confidence on binding constraint
3. Look up decision in matrix

Example:
  Binding: Temporal = 2 (Doubtful)
  Confidence: High
  Decision: NO GO (infeasible with high confidence)

Alternative:
  Binding: Temporal = 2 (Doubtful)
  Confidence: Low
  Decision: INVESTIGATE (may be infeasible, may be unknown)
```

### Record Decision

```yaml
decision:
  raw_score: 2
  binding_dimension: "temporal"
  binding_confidence: "H"
  matrix_lookup: "Infeasible + High Confidence"
  decision: "NO GO"
  rationale: "Critical path exceeds deadline by 20% with high confidence"
```

## 4.3 Conditional Feasibility Map (#403)

**Load:** `data/method-procedures/403_Conditional_Feasibility_Map.md`

**Purpose:** Most projects are not simply "feasible" or "infeasible" — they are "feasible IF." Map ALL conditions.

### Execution Process

1. **List ALL conditions** identified across phases:
   - From scope (#003): "IF Mars delivers data by March"
   - From constraints (#101-106): "IF we can hire Synapse specialist"
   - From dimensions (#201-210): "IF cluster costs stay under $X"
   - From validation (#301-306): "IF no regulatory changes"

2. **For each condition:**

| Attribute | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Probability** | How likely is this condition to hold? (High/Medium/Low/Unknown) |
| **Controller** | Who controls it? (Us/Partner/External/Regulation) |
| **Fallback** | What happens if it fails? Is there a Plan B? |
| **Monitoring** | How will we know if it's failing? |

3. **Calculate compound probability:**
   ```
   If you need 5 independent conditions, each P=0.8:
   Combined P = 0.8^5 = 0.33

   Many "likely" conditions → "unlikely" combined feasibility
   ```

### Record Conditions

```yaml
conditions:
  - condition: "Mars delivers sample data by March 1"
    probability: "Medium"
    controller: "Partner (Mars)"
    fallback: "Design based on spec, risk of rework"
    monitoring: "Weekly check-in with Mars PM"

  - condition: "Synapse specialist hired within 4 weeks"
    probability: "Medium"
    controller: "Us (hiring)"
    fallback: "Train existing team (adds 3 weeks)"
    monitoring: "HR pipeline weekly"

  - condition: "Databricks costs stay under $15K/month"
    probability: "High"
    controller: "Us (architecture)"
    fallback: "Optimize or accept higher cost"
    monitoring: "Cost alerts in Azure"

  - condition: "No EPR regulatory changes before go-live"
    probability: "High"
    controller: "External (EU)"
    fallback: "Re-scope if major changes"
    monitoring: "Regulatory news tracking"

compound_probability:
  independent_conditions: 4
  individual_probabilities: [0.6, 0.6, 0.9, 0.9]
  combined: 0.29  # 60% × 60% × 90% × 90%
  note: "Only 29% chance ALL conditions hold"
```

### Conditional Decision

```
IF all conditions hold → FEASIBLE
IF one condition fails:
  → [Condition 1]: Fallback X, cost Y
  → [Condition 2]: Fallback Z, cost W
  → etc.

Compound probability determines REAL feasibility confidence
```

## 4.4 Feasibility Decay Monitoring (#404)

**Load:** `data/method-procedures/404_Feasibility_Decay_Monitoring.md`

**Purpose:** Feasibility is not static. Design triggers that indicate feasibility is degrading.

### Decay Trigger Types

| Trigger Category | Examples | Dimension Affected |
|-----------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Scope change** | New requirements added | Compositional, Temporal, Cognitive |
| **Team change** | Key person leaves | Knowledge, Resource, Organizational |
| **Dependency change** | API deprecated, vendor acquired | Technical, Dependency |
| **Budget change** | Cut | Resource, Economic |
| **Timeline change** | Accelerated deadline | Temporal |
| **Regulatory change** | New regulation | Regulatory |
| **Technology change** | Major version, deprecation | Technical, Scale |
| **Market change** | Competitor launch | Economic |

### Design Monitoring

For each dimension, identify:
1. **What events would change the score?**
2. **How often to re-check?**
3. **What threshold triggers full reassessment?**

### Reassessment Schedule (Boehm Spiral)

| Milestone | Reassessment Scope |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Sprint boundary | Quick check on binding constraint |
| Phase gate | Standard reassessment of all dimensions |
| Major scope change | Full reassessment |
| External shock | Immediate targeted reassessment |

### Record Decay Monitoring

```yaml
decay_monitoring:
  triggers:
    - event: "Scope change >10%"
      dimensions_affected: ["temporal", "compositional", "cognitive"]
      action: "Reassess affected dimensions"

    - event: "Key team member leaves"
      dimensions_affected: ["knowledge", "resource"]
      action: "Immediate knowledge gap assessment"

    - event: "Budget cut >15%"
      dimensions_affected: ["resource", "economic"]
      action: "Full reassessment"

    - event: "Deadline moved up"
      dimensions_affected: ["temporal"]
      action: "Critical path reanalysis"

  scheduled_reviews:
    - milestone: "End of Sprint 1"
      type: "Quick check"
      focus: ["temporal", "resource"]

    - milestone: "Phase 1 complete"
      type: "Standard reassessment"
      focus: "All dimensions"

    - milestone: "Go-live -4 weeks"
      type: "Final feasibility gate"
      focus: "All dimensions + conditions"
```
