# META Methods Checklist — Continuous Bias Detection
# LOAD: step-05-output.md (final audit), after each phase (continuous)
# PURPOSE: Detect and correct bias in feasibility assessment process itself

---
# LOADING INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Apply after each major phase for early detection
# 2. Apply comprehensive check before final output
# 3. Document findings in META AUDIT section of report

    procedure_file: "data/method-procedures/501_Planning_Fallacy_Detection.md"

    signals:
      - signal: "All dimensions score ≥3"
        meaning: "Possible optimism — compare to reference class"
        action: "Verify against external base rates"

      - signal: "No critical conditions identified"
        meaning: "Likely blind spots in condition mapping"
        action: "Re-examine dependencies and assumptions"

      - signal: "Timeline has no buffer"
        meaning: "Planning fallacy active — optimistic case assumed"
        action: "Add Hofstadter correction"

      - signal: "'If everything goes well' language"
        meaning: "Best case assumed as base case"
        action: "Recalibrate to likely case"

      - signal: "First estimate accepted without challenge"
        meaning: "Anchoring to initial guess"
        action: "Seek independent estimates"

      - signal: "Integration effort < 20% of total"
        meaning: "Almost certainly underestimated"
        action: "Re-estimate integration specifically"

      - signal: "No acknowledged unknowns"
        meaning: "Dunning-Kruger or wishful thinking"
        action: "Explicitly hunt for unknowns"

    correction: |
      IF signals detected:
        1. Apply Hofstadter correction (#502)
        2. Cross-check with reference class (#301)
        3. If no reference class: add 50% to timeline, 80% to cost

  - number: 502
    name: "Hofstadter Correction"
    purpose: "Recursive estimation adjustment"
    when_to_apply: "After all estimation and calibration"
    procedure_file: "data/method-procedures/502_Hofstadter_Correction.md"

    principle: |
      "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take
      into account Hofstadter's Law." — Douglas Hofstadter

    procedure:
      - step: "Take final calibrated estimates"
      - step: "Apply reference-class-based correction factor"
      - step: "If no reference class: ×1.5 (time), ×1.8 (cost)"
      - step: "Gut check: Would a friend laugh at this estimate?"
      - step: "The uncomfortably pessimistic estimate is usually accurate"

    output: |
      Original estimate: [X]
      Correction factor: [Y]
      Adjusted estimate: [X × Y]

  - number: 503
    name: "Confidence Theater Detection"
    purpose: "Distinguish genuine from performed confidence"
    when_to_apply: "After DECIDE"
    procedure_file: "data/method-procedures/503_Confidence_Theater_Detection.md"

    theater_vs_genuine:
      - aspect: "Statements"
        theater: "'We'll definitely deliver' (no basis)"
        genuine: "'Reference class shows 40%, but we have X, Y'"

      - aspect: "Estimates"
        theater: "Single-point (no range)"
        genuine: "Three-point with explicit uncertainty"

      - aspect: "Experience claims"
        theater: "'We've done this before' (different context)"
        genuine: "'We've done pipeline; regulatory module is new'"

      - aspect: "Consensus"
        theater: "Quick agreement without debate"
        genuine: "Agreement after exploring disagreements"

      - aspect: "Concerns"
        theater: "No one mentions risks"
        genuine: "Team actively identifies concerns"

    test: |
      Ask: "What's the most likely way this fails?"
      IF no specific answer → confidence is theatrical

    output: |
      Confidence type: [Genuine / Theatrical]
      Evidence: [What supports this assessment]

  - number: 504
    name: "Dunning-Kruger Dimension Map"
    purpose: "Identify low expertise + high confidence zones"
    when_to_apply: "After ASSESS"
    procedure_file: "data/method-procedures/504_Dunning_Kruger_Dimension_Map.md"

      - expertise: "High"
        confidence: "Low"
        zone: "Imposter Syndrome"

        symbol: "?"

      - expertise: "Low"
        confidence: "Low"
        zone: "Acknowledged Gap"
        action: "Investigation needed — score appropriately uncertain"
        symbol: "!"

      - expertise: "Low"
        confidence: "High"
        zone: "DUNNING-KRUGER ALERT"
        action: "Score unreliable — seek external validation"
        symbol: "⚠"

    procedure:
      - step: "For each of 10 dimensions, rate team EXPERTISE (H/M/L)"
      - step: "For each, rate team CONFIDENCE in score (H/M/L)"
      - step: "Identify DK zones (Low expertise + High confidence)"
      - step: "Flag DK zones for external validation"

    output: |
      Dimension | Expertise | Confidence | Zone
      [name]    | [H/M/L]   | [H/M/L]    | [zone]
      ...

  - number: 505
    name: "Meta-Feasibility Check"
    purpose: "Can we even assess feasibility?"
    when_to_apply: "During FRAME, after VALIDATE"
    procedure_file: "data/method-procedures/505_Meta_Feasibility_Check.md"

    infeasibility_conditions:
      - condition: "Problem is in Complex domain"
        meaning: "Emergent, unpredictable — traditional analysis invalid"
        alternative: "Design probes (#303)"

      - condition: "No reference class exists"
        meaning: "Truly novel — no base rates available"
        alternative: "Analogies + wider uncertainty bands"

      - condition: "Key variables unknowable in advance"
        meaning: "Cannot assess without doing"
        alternative: "Small bets to learn"

      - condition: "Assessment cost ≈ project cost"
        meaning: "Bonini's paradox — model as complex as reality"
        alternative: "Accept bounded analysis"

    procedure:
      - step: "Check each infeasibility condition"
      - step: "If any apply: acknowledge limitation"
      - step: "Shift strategy appropriately"
      - step: "Set max investment threshold for learning"

      Assessable: [Yes / Partial / No]
