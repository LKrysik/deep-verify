# Method Clusters — Correlation Rules for Method Selection
# LOAD: step-02-targeted.md
# PURPOSE: Avoid redundant method execution by grouping correlated methods

---
# LOADING INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Load this file at the START of step-02 (Targeted Analysis)
# 2. Before executing a method, check its cluster
# 3. If another method from same cluster already executed:
#    - If first found nothing → SKIP rest of cluster
#    - If first found something → one more can confirm, then SKIP
# 4. Never execute 3+ methods from same cluster
# 5. To execute a method, READ its procedure file from method_procedures path

    rule: |
      If first method finds nothing → skip rest of cluster.
      If first method finds something → one more can confirm.
      Never execute 3+ methods from this cluster.

    correlation: MEDIUM
    rule: |
      Lower correlation — can use both.
      These attack from genuinely different angles.
    rationale: "Challenge methods use different attack vectors"
    note: "#63 (Challenge from Critical Perspective) is conceptually related but is Tier 3 — reserved for Phase 3 adversarial review only"

# HOW TO USE THIS FILE:
#
# 1. Phase 1: Execute all tier1_methods (mandatory)
#    - For each method, READ its procedure file
#    - Follow step-by-step instructions from the file
#
# 2. Phase 2: Check signal_to_cluster_mapping for recommended methods
#    - Find matching signal from Phase 1 findings
#    - Select method from recommended_methods
#    - READ the procedure file at the path listed
#    - Execute method following the procedure
#
# 3. Before executing any method:
#    - Check if cluster already had method executed
#    - Apply cluster rules
#
# 4. CRITICAL: Always READ the procedure file before executing a method
#    The procedure file contains step-by-step instructions and output format
