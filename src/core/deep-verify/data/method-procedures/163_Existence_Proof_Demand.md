# #163 Existence Proof Demand

**Tier:** 2 (Signal-based - Phase 2)
**Purpose:** Challenge unproven capability claims.

## What to do

1. For each major capability claimed, demand existence proof:
   - Formal proof
   - Reference to existing system
   - Constructive example
2. Inability to provide any = unsubstantiated claim

## Step-by-step

```
1. Identify capability claims:
   "System achieves X while maintaining Y"

2. Demand proof:
   - Formal proof? Not provided
   - Reference system? None cited
   - Constructive example? Not given

3. Assess:
   - Is X+Y known to be achievable?
   - Has anyone done this before?
   - Is this novel combination?

4. If novel and unproven → UNSUBSTANTIATED
```

## Output format

```
Capability claims:
| Claim | Formal proof | Reference | Example | Verdict |
|-------|-------------|-----------|---------|---------|
| [C1]  | [Y/N]       | [Y/N]     | [Y/N]   | [S/U]   |
| [C2]  | [Y/N]       | [Y/N]     | [Y/N]   | [S/U]   |

S = Substantiated, U = Unsubstantiated

FINDING (if any): Claim "[X]" is unsubstantiated
QUOTE: "[exact claim]"
SEVERITY: [CRITICAL if core claim, IMPORTANT otherwise]
