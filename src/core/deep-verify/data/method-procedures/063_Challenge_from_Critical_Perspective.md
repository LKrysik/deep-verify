# #63 Challenge from Critical Perspective

**Tier:** 3 (Adversarial - Phase 3)
**Purpose:** Play devil's advocate to find weaknesses.

## What to do

1. Assume role of hostile critic
2. Construct strongest possible argument that artifact is flawed
3. Use all previous findings as ammunition
4. Synthesize: Do findings combine into systemic problem?

## Step-by-step

```
1. Adopt adversarial mindset:
   "I want to prove this artifact is fatally flawed"

2. Review all findings:
   - F1: [description]
   - F2: [description]
   - F3: [description]

3. Construct attack:
   "The combination of [F1] and [F2] means that
   under condition X, the system will fail because..."

4. Test attack strength:
   - Is this a realistic scenario?
   - Would this actually happen?
   - Is there a defense not mentioned?

5. Synthesize:
   "Individually these are [severity], but together
   they represent a systemic [vulnerability/flaw]"
```

## Output format

```
Adversarial critique:

Individual findings:
- [F1]: [severity] — [description]
- [F2]: [severity] — [description]

Combined attack:
[Description of how findings combine into larger problem]

Attack strength: [weak/moderate/strong/devastating]

Synthesis:
□ Findings are independent → no amplification
□ Findings compound → elevated concern
□ Findings create systemic failure → CRITICAL

FINDING (if any): Systemic issue from combined [F1, F2, ...]
QUOTE: [quotes from multiple locations]
SEVERITY: [based on synthesis, often elevated]
```
