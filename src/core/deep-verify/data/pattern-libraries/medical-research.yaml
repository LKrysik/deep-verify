clinical_trials:
  BLINDING_CONTRADICTION:
    id: MR-001
    name: "Double-Blind + Obvious Treatment"
    signals:
      - "double-blind"
      - "blinded study"
      - "obvious side effects"
      - "distinguishable treatment"
      - "surgical intervention"
    why_impossible: |
      Double-blinding requires treatment and placebo to be indistinguishable.
      Treatments with obvious effects (surgery, visible side effects) cannot be truly blinded.
      Functional unblinding compromises study validity.
    detection_methods: ["154_Definitional_Contradiction_Detector.md", "071_First_Principles_Analysis.md"]
    severity: CRITICAL
    check: "Does study claim double-blind while using distinguishable intervention?"

  RANDOMIZATION_BIAS:
    id: MR-002
    name: "Randomization Claim + Selection Bias"
    signals:
      - "randomized"
      - "random assignment"
      - "selected patients"
      - "eligible if"
      - "excluded if"
    why_problematic: |
      Strict inclusion/exclusion criteria can introduce selection bias.
      "Randomized among selected" is not the same as "randomly sampled from population."
      Generalizability claims must match recruitment reality.
    detection_methods: ["085_Grounding_Check.md", "100_Vocabulary_Consistency.md"]
    severity: IMPORTANT
    check: "Do generalizability claims acknowledge selection criteria limitations?"

  INTENT_TO_TREAT_VIOLATION:
    id: MR-003
    name: "Intent-to-Treat + Per-Protocol Confusion"
    signals:
      - "intent to treat"
      - "ITT analysis"
      - "per protocol"
      - "completers only"
      - "excluded dropouts"
    why_problematic: |
      ITT and per-protocol analyses answer different questions.
      Claiming ITT while excluding dropouts is contradictory.
      Analysis type must match actual inclusion criteria.
    detection_methods: ["154_Definitional_Contradiction_Detector.md", "100_Vocabulary_Consistency.md"]
    severity: CRITICAL
    check: "Does analysis claim ITT while using per-protocol exclusions?"

statistical_validity:
  P_HACKING_INDICATORS:
    id: MR-004
    name: "Multiple Comparisons Without Correction"
    signals:
      - "p < 0.05"
      - "statistically significant"
      - "multiple endpoints"
      - "subgroup analysis"
      - no Bonferroni/FDR mention
    why_problematic: |
      Multiple comparisons inflate false positive rate.
      20 comparisons at p=0.05 expects 1 false positive.
      Uncorrected p-values in multiple comparison context are misleading.
    detection_methods: ["153_Theoretical_Impossibility_Check.md", "085_Grounding_Check.md"]
    severity: CRITICAL
    check: "Are multiple comparisons made without statistical correction?"

  UNDERPOWERED_CLAIMS:
    id: MR-005
    name: "Strong Claims from Underpowered Study"
    signals:
      - "no significant difference"
      - "equivalent"
      - "non-inferior"
      - small sample size
      - "pilot study"
    why_problematic: |
      Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
      Underpowered studies cannot support non-inferiority claims.
      Pilot studies are hypothesis-generating, not confirming.
    detection_methods: ["153_Theoretical_Impossibility_Check.md", "085_Grounding_Check.md"]
    severity: CRITICAL
    check: "Does study make strong negative claims without adequate power?"

regulatory_compliance:
  FDA_LEARNING_DEVICE:
    id: MR-006
    name: "FDA Class III + Continuous Learning"
    signals:
      - "FDA Class III"
      - "PMA"
      - "high-risk device"
      - "continuous learning"
      - "adaptive algorithm"
      - "self-updating"
    why_impossible: |
      FDA Class III devices require Premarket Approval (PMA) for each model change.
      Continuous learning means constant model changes.
      Each change would require new PMA submission.
    exception: "Class II with PCCP (Predetermined Change Control Plan) allows pre-specified changes"
    detection_methods: ["153_Theoretical_Impossibility_Check.md"]
    severity: CRITICAL
    check: "Does artifact claim Class III approval AND continuous learning?"

  HIPAA_RICH_ANALYTICS:
    id: MR-007
    name: "HIPAA Compliance + Rich Analytics"
    signals:
      - "HIPAA compliant"
      - "patient data analytics"
      - "health insights"
      - "medical records analysis"
    why_problematic: |
      De-identification is required for analytics without patient consent.
      Rich analytics may enable re-identification.
      Must specify: Expert Determination or Safe Harbor method?
    detection_methods: ["085_Grounding_Check.md"]
    severity: IMPORTANT
    severity_if_unspecified: CRITICAL
    check: "Does artifact claim HIPAA compliance with analytics without de-identification method?"

  OFF_LABEL_PROMOTION:
    id: MR-008
    name: "Off-Label Use Promotion"
    signals:
      - "FDA approved for"
      - "also effective for"
      - "additional uses"
      - "recommended for"
    why_problematic: |
      Promoting off-label uses violates FDA regulations.
      Approved indication must match promotional claims.
      "Evidence suggests" for unapproved uses is promotional language.
    detection_methods: ["071_First_Principles_Analysis.md", "085_Grounding_Check.md"]
    severity: CRITICAL
    check: "Does artifact promote uses beyond approved indications?"

# USAGE SUMMARY:
#
# Medical research patterns focus on:
# - Clinical trial design validity
# - Statistical methodology soundness
# - Regulatory compliance (FDA, HIPAA)
# - Evidence quality assessment
#
# Use with core.yaml for comprehensive coverage.
# These patterns help verify clinical protocols, research papers, and medical device documents.
