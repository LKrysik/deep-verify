api_documentation:
  ENDPOINT_MISMATCH:
    id: DOC-001
    name: "Documented Endpoint != Actual Endpoint"
    signals:
      - "endpoint:"
      - "URL:"
      - "route:"
      - "/api/"
      - documented paths
    why_problematic: |
      Documented endpoints must match actual implementation.
      Stale documentation leads to integration failures.
      Version mismatches between docs and code are common failure modes.
    detection_methods: ["085_Grounding_Check.md", "084_Coherence_Check.md"]
    severity: CRITICAL
    check: "Can documented endpoints be verified against actual implementation?"

  SCHEMA_DOC_DRIFT:
    id: DOC-002
    name: "Request/Response Schema Drift"
    signals:
      - "request body"
      - "response format"
      - "schema:"
      - "required fields"
      - "optional fields"
    why_problematic: |
      Schema documentation must match actual API behavior.
      Required fields that aren't actually required cause confusion.
      Missing field documentation leads to runtime surprises.
    detection_methods: ["084_Coherence_Check.md", "100_Vocabulary_Consistency.md"]
    severity: CRITICAL
    check: "Do documented schemas match actual request/response formats?"

  ERROR_COVERAGE_GAP:
    id: DOC-003
    name: "Incomplete Error Documentation"
    signals:
      - "error codes"
      - "status codes"
      - "400 Bad Request"
      - "error handling"
    why_problematic: |
      Undocumented errors leave consumers unprepared.
      Documented errors that never occur waste implementation effort.
      Error semantics must be accurate for proper handling.
    detection_methods: ["086_Topological_Hole_Detection.md", "078_Assumption_Excavation.md"]
    severity: IMPORTANT
    check: "Are all possible error conditions documented with accurate descriptions?"

code_doc_mismatch:
  EXAMPLE_OUTDATED:
    id: DOC-004
    name: "Non-Functional Code Examples"
    signals:
      - "example:"
      - "code sample"
      - "usage:"
      - "```"
    why_problematic: |
      Code examples should be executable and produce documented results.
      Outdated examples teach wrong patterns.
      Untested examples may contain syntax or logic errors.
    detection_methods: ["085_Grounding_Check.md", "087_Falsifiability_Check.md"]
    severity: IMPORTANT
    check: "Do code examples actually work as documented?"

  BEHAVIOR_DOCUMENTATION:
    id: DOC-005
    name: "Documented Behavior != Actual Behavior"
    signals:
      - "will return"
      - "throws exception"
      - "triggers event"
      - "side effect"
    why_problematic: |
      Behavioral claims must match implementation.
      Documented side effects that don't occur break expectations.
      Missing documentation of actual side effects causes bugs.
    detection_methods: ["084_Coherence_Check.md", "154_Definitional_Contradiction_Detector.md"]
    severity: CRITICAL
    check: "Do documented behaviors match actual implementation behavior?"

versioning:
  VERSION_FEATURE_MISMATCH:
    id: DOC-006
    name: "Version-Feature Inconsistency"
    signals:
      - "since version"
      - "deprecated in"
      - "removed in"
      - "added in"
      - version numbers
    why_problematic: |
      Feature availability must match version claims.
      "Since v2.0" features must not appear in v1.x docs without warning.
      Deprecation timelines must be consistent across documentation.
    detection_methods: ["159_Transitive_Dependency_Closure.md", "084_Coherence_Check.md"]
    severity: IMPORTANT
    check: "Are version-feature associations consistent throughout documentation?"

# USAGE SUMMARY:
#
# Documentation patterns focus on:
# - API documentation accuracy
# - Code example validity
# - Version consistency
# - Behavior documentation correctness
#
# Use with core.yaml for comprehensive coverage.
# These patterns help verify technical documentation, API references, and developer guides.
