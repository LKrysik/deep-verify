17,advanced,Abstraction Laddering,"Move up (why does this matter?) and down (how specifically?) levels of abstraction to find optimal framing. Check vertical coherence: Do promises at one level match details at another? Check for gaps: Are there jumps where intermediate steps are missing? Check for orphans: Are there details that don't connect to any higher goal?",concrete → abstract → concrete → optimal level,step-01 (Tier 1 mandatory),1
71,core,First Principles Analysis,"Strip away assumptions to rebuild from fundamental truths. Identify the 3-5 core claims of the artifact. For each claim ask: What must be fundamentally true for this to work? Check if those fundamentals are: explicitly stated and justified, consistent with known constraints (physics/math/regulations), not contradicting each other.",assumptions → truths → new approach,step-01 (Tier 1 mandatory),1
78,core,Assumption Excavation,"Dig through three layers: surface (conscious) inherited (learned) invisible (cultural) assumptions then stress test each. For each mechanism or claim ask: What must be true for this to work? Check if assumption is stated explicitly, stated implicitly, or unstated (hidden). For unstated assumptions assess: Is this assumption reasonable? Always true?",surface → inherited → invisible → stress test,step-02 (ungrounded signals),2
84,sanity,Coherence Check,"Check definitions are stable throughout and search for contradictions or redundant definitions with quotes from each location. For each section summarize its key claim in one sentence. Compare claims across sections: Do they support each other? Do any contradict? Are there gaps (A assumes X but X never established)?",definitions → consistency check → contradictions → redundancy,step-02 (diffuse belief),2
85,sanity,Grounding Check,"List all explicit and hidden assumptions with evidence and impact-if-false analysis plus CUI BONO on each. For each significant claim ask: What evidence supports this? Classify evidence as: Explicit (cited demonstrated), Implicit (follows logically), Missing (assertion without support). Flag all claims with missing evidence.",explicit → hidden → evidence → impact if false → CUI BONO,step-02 (ungrounded signals),2
86,sanity,Topological Hole Detection,"Map elements as graph and find persistent holes: dead ends/cycles without closure/high-inbound-no-outbound clusters. Build dependency graph: Nodes = components concepts mechanisms. Edges = depends on/influences/calls. Find cycles (DFS or visual inspection). For each cycle: Is there a breaking condition? Is there dampening?",elements → graph → abstraction filtering → persistent holes,step-02 (structural complexity),2
100,coherence,Vocabulary Consistency,"Extract all key terms and identify synonyms (same concept different words) and homonyms (same word different concepts). For each term find all locations where it's used. Check: Is the term used consistently everywhere? Look for: Synonyms (same concept different words) = potential confusion. Homonyms (same word different meanings) = potential contradiction.",terms → synonyms → homonyms → standardization,step-01 (Tier 1 mandatory),1
109,exploration,Contraposition Inversion,"Instead of what leads to success answer what guarantees failure then check if current solution does any of those. For each key claim 'If A then B' consider 'If not-B then not-A'. Ask: What would have to be true for this system to fail? Check: Are those failure conditions addressed? Known guarantees: async+consensus+failures=FLP violation; SP+IR+EFF+BB=M-S violation.",success goal → failure paths → theorem check → remove failures,step-02 (diffuse belief / clean phase 1),2
116,epistemology,Strange Loop Detection,"Build justification graph and detect cycles - each cycle needs external anchor or reasoning is ungrounded. Build dependency graph: Nodes = components concepts mechanisms. Edges = depends on/influences/calls. Find cycles. For each cycle: Is there a breaking condition? Is there dampening? Could this cause infinite regress or instability?",claims → graph → cycles → external anchors,step-02 (structural complexity),2
130,challenge,Assumption Torture,"For each key assumption test at 10% wrong then 50% wrong then completely wrong - which errors are survivable vs catastrophic? Imagine assumption is wrong at different levels: 10% wrong (minor deviation), 50% wrong (significant deviation), 100% wrong (completely invalid). What happens to the system at each level? Is there graceful degradation or catastrophic failure?",assumptions → graduated error test → catastrophe identification,step-02 (ungrounded signals),2
153,theory,Theoretical Impossibility Check,"Check claims against known impossibility theorems: FLP (async consensus) CAP (distributed) Halting/Rice/Gödel (computation) Myerson-Satterthwaite (mechanism) Arrow (voting) No-Free-Lunch (optimization). If claim matches theorem pattern: Does artifact acknowledge the trade-off? Is there a valid exception or workaround? If claim violates theorem → CRITICAL finding.",claims → theorem scan → violation detection → impossibility classification,step-02 (absolute claims),2
154,theory,Definitional Contradiction Detector,"Find requirements that are DEFINITIONALLY mutually exclusive - not just hard to achieve together but logically impossible by definition. List all requirements as R1 R2 R3. For each requirement expand: MEANS (literal) IMPLIES (logical consequence) EXCLUDES (incompatible). For each pair check: Does Ri.EXCLUDES overlap with Rj.MEANS or IMPLIES? If yes → definitional contradiction.",requirements → definition expansion → exclusion check → definitional vs practical conflict,step-02 (absolute claims),2
159,depend,Transitive Dependency Closure,"Build dependency graph then compute transitive closure via DFS. Path A→...→A = circular dependency. Node with in-degree>0 and no definition = missing dependency. Catches indirect dependency issues that pairwise analysis misses.",graph → DFS → cycles → missing → transitive conflicts,step-02 (structural complexity),2
163,theory,Existence Proof Demand,"For each major capability or property claimed demand existence proof: formal proof OR reference to existing system OR constructive example. Inability to provide any = unsubstantiated claim. Especially critical for novel feature combinations that have never been demonstrated together.",claims → proof demand → proof/reference/example → substantiated or unsubstantiated,step-02 (absolute claims),2
63,risk,Challenge from Critical Perspective,"Play devil's advocate to stress-test ideas and find weaknesses - essential for overcoming groupthink. Assume the role of a hostile critic. Construct the strongest possible argument that the artifact is fundamentally flawed. Use all findings from previous methods as ammunition. Synthesize: Do the individual findings combine into a systemic problem?",consensus → challenges → strengthening,step-03 (adversarial),3
165,theory,Constructive Counterexample,"Actively attempt to construct counterexamples that break claimed properties. For each claim: identify what would violate it → attempt construction → if construction succeeds claim is false. More rigorous than theoretical analysis alone because it demonstrates actual failure rather than theoretical possibility.",claim → violation definition → construction attempt → success = CRITICAL finding,step-02 (absolute claims) / step-03,2
87,sanity,Falsifiability Check,"For each claim specify what evidence would prove it wrong. Theoretical claims may be unfalsifiable by THEOREM not just lack of test. Check: does claim contradict FLP/CAP/Halting/Rice/Gödel/M-S? Mark claims as: Falsifiable (testable), Unfalsifiable-by-theorem (known impossibility), Unfalsifiable-by-design (untestable).",claims → falsification criteria → theorem check → testing status,step-02 (theorem violations),2
162,theory,Theory-Dependence Verification,"Verify theoretical claims have proper backing. For each claim: identify theory relied upon → check if theory supports claim → verify no misapplication → demand proof or reference. Flags: soundness without proof / termination without checker proof / guarantees without theorems.",claims → theory identification → support check → proof demand → classification,step-02 (absolute claims),2
