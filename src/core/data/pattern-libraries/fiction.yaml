timeline_consistency:
  TEMPORAL_PARADOX:
    id: FW-001
    name: "Unresolved Temporal Paradox"
    signals:
      - "before X happened"
      - "after the event"
      - "meanwhile"
      - "at the same time"
      - conflicting timestamps
      - age inconsistencies
    why_impossible: |
      Events cannot occur both before AND after each other.
      Character ages must progress consistently with timeline.
      Simultaneous events in different locations need travel time consideration.
    detection_methods: ["084_Coherence_Check.md", "159_Transitive_Dependency_Closure.md"]
    severity: CRITICAL
    check: "Do events contradict each other temporally without in-world explanation?"

  IMPOSSIBLE_TRAVEL_TIME:
    id: FW-002
    name: "Impossible Travel/Communication Time"
    signals:
      - "arrived immediately"
      - "instant message"
      - distance references
      - travel time claims
    why_problematic: |
      Unless world has established fast-travel/communication, physical limits apply.
      Characters cannot traverse large distances without time passing.
      Consistency with established in-world physics required.
    exception: "Valid if world establishes teleportation, faster-than-light, etc."
    detection_methods: ["071_First_Principles_Analysis.md", "085_Grounding_Check.md"]
    severity: IMPORTANT
    check: "Does travel/communication time violate established world physics?"

  FLASHBACK_PARADOX:
    id: FW-003
    name: "Flashback/Memory Contradiction"
    signals:
      - "remembered"
      - "flashback"
      - "recalled"
      - "years ago"
    why_problematic: |
      Flashback content must be consistent with established past events.
      Characters cannot remember events differently than shown.
      Memory details must not contradict documented history.
    detection_methods: ["084_Coherence_Check.md", "100_Vocabulary_Consistency.md"]
    severity: IMPORTANT
    check: "Do flashbacks contradict previously established events?"
---
character_consistency:
  KNOWLEDGE_PARADOX:
    id: FW-004
    name: "Character Knowledge Paradox"
    signals:
      - "knew about"
      - "didn't know"
      - "surprised to learn"
      - "already knew"
    why_impossible: |
      Characters cannot know information they haven't received.
      Characters cannot be surprised by information they already have.
      Knowledge state must be traceable through narrative.
    detection_methods: ["159_Transitive_Dependency_Closure.md", "116_Strange_Loop_Detection.md"]
    severity: CRITICAL
    check: "Does a character know something they couldn't know, or not know something they should?"

  CAPABILITY_INCONSISTENCY:
    id: FW-005
    name: "Inconsistent Character Capabilities"
    signals:
      - "suddenly able to"
      - "couldn't do before"
      - "expert at"
      - "never learned"
    why_problematic: |
      Character abilities must be established or developed on-page.
      Sudden expertise without training or explanation breaks consistency.
      Power levels should progress logically.
    exception: "Valid if story establishes sudden power gain mechanism"
    detection_methods: ["085_Grounding_Check.md", "084_Coherence_Check.md"]
    severity: IMPORTANT
    check: "Do character capabilities change without in-story justification?"

  MOTIVATION_CONTRADICTION:
    id: FW-006
    name: "Contradictory Character Motivation"
    signals:
      - "wanted to"
      - "refused to"
      - "goal was"
      - "decided to"
    why_problematic: |
      Character motivations should be internally consistent.
      Actions contradicting stated goals need explanation.
      Character arcs should show logical progression.
    detection_methods: ["084_Coherence_Check.md", "154_Definitional_Contradiction_Detector.md"]
    severity: IMPORTANT
    check: "Do character actions contradict their established motivations without reason?"
---
world_building:
  RULE_VIOLATION:
    id: FW-007
    name: "World Rule Violation"
    signals:
      - "magic cannot"
      - "technology allows"
      - "impossible in this world"
      - "the rules state"
    why_impossible: |
      Established world rules must be followed or explicitly broken with consequence.
      If magic cannot do X, characters cannot use magic to do X.
      Technology limitations must be consistent.
    detection_methods: ["071_First_Principles_Analysis.md", "154_Definitional_Contradiction_Detector.md"]
    severity: CRITICAL
    check: "Do events violate explicitly established world rules?"

  ECONOMY_IMPOSSIBILITY:
    id: FW-008
    name: "Economic/Resource Impossibility"
    signals:
      - "unlimited resources"
      - "no cost"
      - "abundance"
      - "scarcity"
      - "trade"
    why_problematic: |
      Resource economics must be internally consistent.
      Scarcity and abundance claims must not contradict.
      Trade relationships need logical basis.
    detection_methods: ["084_Coherence_Check.md", "085_Grounding_Check.md"]
    severity: IMPORTANT
    check: "Are resource/economic claims internally consistent?"

# USAGE SUMMARY:
#
# Fiction patterns focus on:
# - Timeline and causality consistency
# - Character knowledge and capability tracking
# - World rule adherence
# - Internal logic of fictional systems
#
# Use with core.yaml for comprehensive coverage.
# These patterns help verify narrative documents, story outlines, and fiction manuscripts.
