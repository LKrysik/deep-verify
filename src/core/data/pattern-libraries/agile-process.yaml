story_definition:
  UNTESTABLE_ACCEPTANCE:
    id: AG-001
    name: "Untestable Acceptance Criteria"
    signals:
      - "acceptance criteria"
      - "given/when/then"
      - "should work"
      - "properly"
      - "correctly"
    why_problematic: |
      Acceptance criteria must be objectively testable.
      "Should work properly" is not testable.
      Each criterion should map to a specific test case.
    detection_methods: ["085_Grounding_Check.md", "087_Falsifiability_Check.md"]
    severity: IMPORTANT
    check: "Can each acceptance criterion be converted to a pass/fail test?"

  STORY_SCOPE_VIOLATION:
    id: AG-002
    name: "Story Violates INVEST Principles"
    signals:
      - "user story"
      - "as a user"
      - "I want"
      - "so that"
      - story format
    why_problematic: |
      Stories should be Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable.
      Stories dependent on unfinished work violate independence.
      Stories too large to estimate or complete in a sprint violate "small."
    detection_methods: ["084_Coherence_Check.md", "078_Assumption_Excavation.md"]
    severity: IMPORTANT
    check: "Does the story violate any INVEST principle?"

  HIDDEN_DEPENDENCY:
    id: AG-003
    name: "Undocumented Story Dependencies"
    signals:
      - "after"
      - "once"
      - "when X is done"
      - "requires"
      - "blocked"
    why_problematic: |
      Hidden dependencies cause sprint planning failures.
      Stories cannot be parallelized if dependencies are unknown.
      All blockers must be explicit in story definition.
    detection_methods: ["159_Transitive_Dependency_Closure.md", "078_Assumption_Excavation.md"]
    severity: CRITICAL
    check: "Are all story dependencies explicitly documented?"

sprint_artifacts:
  VELOCITY_MANIPULATION:
    id: AG-004
    name: "Velocity Gaming"
    signals:
      - "story points"
      - "velocity"
      - "burndown"
      - "commitment"
      - point inflation
    why_problematic: |
      Velocity is a planning tool, not a performance metric.
      Inflating points to "increase velocity" defeats the purpose.
      Velocity should reflect actual team capacity, not targets.
    detection_methods: ["085_Grounding_Check.md", "087_Falsifiability_Check.md"]
    severity: IMPORTANT
    check: "Is velocity being used as a performance target rather than planning tool?"

  SPRINT_OVERCOMMITMENT:
    id: AG-005
    name: "Sprint Overcommitment Pattern"
    signals:
      - "committed to"
      - "sprint goal"
      - "capacity"
      - story point total
      - historical velocity
    why_problematic: |
      Sprint commitment should align with historical velocity.
      Consistent overcommitment indicates planning dysfunction.
      80% capacity planning accounts for meetings, bugs, and unknowns.
    detection_methods: ["071_First_Principles_Analysis.md", "085_Grounding_Check.md"]
    severity: IMPORTANT
    check: "Does sprint commitment exceed team's demonstrated capacity?"

estimation:
  PRECISION_ILLUSION:
    id: AG-006
    name: "False Estimation Precision"
    signals:
      - "exactly 3 days"
      - "2.5 story points"
      - "4 hours"
      - precise estimates
    why_problematic: |
      Estimation inherently has uncertainty.
      "Exactly 3 days" implies false precision.
      Ranges or relative sizing (S/M/L) more honest than precise numbers.
    detection_methods: ["085_Grounding_Check.md", "078_Assumption_Excavation.md"]
    severity: MINOR
    check: "Do estimates claim more precision than methodology supports?"

# USAGE SUMMARY:
#
# Agile process patterns focus on:
# - Story quality and testability
# - Sprint planning realism
# - Estimation honesty
# - Dependency management
#
# Use with core.yaml for comprehensive coverage.
# These patterns help verify sprint backlogs, story definitions, and agile artifacts.
