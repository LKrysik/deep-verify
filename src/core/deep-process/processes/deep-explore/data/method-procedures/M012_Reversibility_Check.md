# M012: Reversibility Check

## Purpose

Assess how hard it is to change course after choosing.

## Core Question

```
"If we choose [X] and it's wrong, how hard is it to undo?"
```

## Procedure

### 1. Assess Reversibility

```
OPTION: [name]

REVERSIBILITY: [HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW / IRREVERSIBLE]

HIGH:
Can change direction with minimal cost
Example: switching libraries early in project

MEDIUM:
Can change with significant cost
Example: changing database with some data

LOW:
Very difficult to change
Example: changing language mid-project

IRREVERSIBLE:
Cannot undo
Example: public announcement, legal commitment
```

### 2. Identify Point of No Return

```
POINT OF NO RETURN:

Time-based: "After [X months] of development"
Event-based: "After [first customer / funding / launch]"
Investment-based: "After [X hours / $Y spent]"

SPECIFIC: ___________________________
```

### 3. Assess Recovery

```
IF IT FAILS:

Can we recover? [Y/N]
Recovery cost: [LOW / MED / HIGH]
Recovery time: [estimate]
What's lost: [sunk costs]
```

### 4. Implications

```
HIGH reversibility → Can decide faster, less research needed
LOW reversibility → Need more confidence before committing
IRREVERSIBLE → Requires highest confidence level
```

## Output

```
OPTION: [name]

REVERSIBILITY: [level]
POINT OF NO RETURN: [when]
RECOVERY: possible: [Y/N], cost: [level]

IMPLICATION: [what this means for decision]
```
