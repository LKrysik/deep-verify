# E013: Contrast Exploration

## Purpose

Learn from others' successes and failures. Locate your space by comparison.

## Core Question

```
"Who has done something similar? Who tried and failed? How am I different?"
```

## Why This Matters

You are not the first person to attempt something.

By studying others, you get:
- Context (what's normal)
- Boundaries (what failed)
- Leverage points (what made difference)

You don't copy - you locate your own space.

## Procedure

### 1. Find Comparables

```
WHO HAS DONE SOMETHING SIMILAR?

Successes:
• [person/company] - what they did: ___
• [person/company] - what they did: ___

Failures:
• [person/company] - what they tried: ___
• [person/company] - what they tried: ___
```

### 2. Analyze Successes

```
For each success:

WHO: [name]
WHAT: [what they achieved]
HOW: [key factors in their success]
CONTEXT: [their situation, resources, timing]

KEY SUCCESS FACTORS:
• [factor 1]
• [factor 2]
• [factor 3]
```

### 3. Analyze Failures

```
For each failure:

WHO: [name]
WHAT: [what they tried]
WHY FAILED: [root causes]
CONTEXT: [their situation]

KEY FAILURE FACTORS:
• [factor 1]
• [factor 2]
• [factor 3]
```

### 4. Compare to Your Situation

```
HOW AM I DIFFERENT FROM SUCCESSES?

Advantages I have:
• [advantage] - because: ___

Disadvantages I have:
• [disadvantage] - because: ___

HOW AM I DIFFERENT FROM FAILURES?

Same risks I face:
• [risk] - my mitigation: ___

Risks I avoid:
• [risk] - why I avoid it: ___
```

### 5. Locate Your Space

```
POSITIONING MAP:

                SUCCESS FACTORS
                ↑
    [Failure A] │     [Success A]
                │
        ────────┼──────── FAILURE FACTORS →
                │
    [Failure B] │  [YOU?]  [Success B]
                │

WHERE I AM:
• Similar to [X] because: ___
• Different from [X] because: ___
• My unique angle: ___
```

### 6. Extract Lessons

```
FROM SUCCESSES:
• Copy: [what to replicate]
• Adapt: [what to modify for my context]
• Avoid copying: [what worked for them, won't for me]

FROM FAILURES:
• Avoid: [what not to do]
• Do differently: [same goal, different approach]
• Monitor: [early warning signs]
```

## Contrast Questions

```
• What did successful people have that I don't?
• What did failing people lack that I have?
• What's the key difference between success and failure cases?
• Where is there a gap no one has addressed?
• What has changed since others tried? (timing, technology, market)
```

## Output

```
CONTRAST EXPLORATION

COMPARABLES ANALYZED:
• Successes: [count]
• Failures: [count]

SUCCESS FACTORS:
• [factor 1] - do I have it? [Y/N]
• [factor 2] - do I have it? [Y/N]

FAILURE FACTORS:
• [factor 1] - does it apply to me? [Y/N]
• [factor 2] - does it apply to me? [Y/N]

MY POSITION:
• Similar to: [who/what]
• Different because: [key difference]
• My advantage: [what I have others didn't]
• My risk: [what I share with failures]

LESSONS:
• Copy: ___
• Avoid: ___
• Unique opportunity: ___
```
