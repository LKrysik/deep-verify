# Risk Pattern Libraries Manifest
# These libraries contain domain-specific failure patterns for Historical Pattern Matching (#106)

version: "1.0.0"
description: |
  Risk pattern libraries provide survivorship-corrected historical failure patterns.
  Each pattern includes: signature, anti-patterns, and indicators.

  Usage:
  - Match current system characteristics against pattern signatures
  - Check for presence of known anti-patterns
  - Monitor for pattern-specific early warning indicators

usage_guidance:
  selection: |
    1. Start with 'core' library - applies to all projects
    2. Add domain libraries based on system characteristics
    3. Prioritize patterns where >2 signature elements match

  matching_threshold:
    high_match: ">= 3 signature elements present"
    moderate_match: "2 signature elements present"
    low_match: "1 signature element present"

  survivorship_note: |
    These patterns are collected from FAILED projects and incidents.
    Successful projects that had these patterns but succeeded are NOT included.
    This is intentional - we want to flag risk, not guarantee failure.

    The presence of a pattern means "this has caused failure before"
    not "this will definitely cause failure."
