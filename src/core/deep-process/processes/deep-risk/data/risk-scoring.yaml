dimensions:
  probability:
    symbol: P
    scale: 1-5
    question: "How likely is this to occur?"
    anchors:
      1: "<5% in project lifetime"
      2: "5-20%"
      3: "20-50%"
      4: "50-80%"
      5: ">80%, near-certain"

  impact:
    symbol: I
    scale: 1-5
    question: "How severe are the consequences?"
    anchors:
      1: "Minor inconvenience, workaround exists"
      2: "Noticeable delay or cost, contained"
      3: "Significant — requires plan revision"
      4: "Major — threatens project objectives"
      5: "Catastrophic — project failure, legal, safety"

  velocity:
    symbol: V
    scale: 1-5
    question: "How fast does it materialize once triggered?"
    anchors:
      1: "Months — slow development, time to respond"
      2: "Weeks — noticeable progression"
      3: "Days — rapid escalation"
      4: "Hours — very fast"
      5: "Instant — no warning once triggered"

  detectability:
    symbol: D
    scale: 1-5
    question: "How hard to detect BEFORE impact?"
    anchors:
      1: "Obvious — clear early warning signs"
      2: "Noticeable — requires attention but visible"
      3: "Moderate — requires monitoring to catch"
      4: "Difficult — subtle signs, easy to miss"
      5: "Invisible — no warning until impact"

  reversibility:
    symbol: R
    scale: 1-5
    question: "How hard to recover after materialization?"
    anchors:
      1: "Trivially undone — simple rollback"
      2: "Easy recovery — known procedure exists"
      3: "Moderate — requires effort and time"
      4: "Difficult — major effort, uncertain outcome"
      5: "Permanent — cannot be undone"

composite_formula:
  formula: "P × I × max(V, D, R)"
  rationale: |
    The max() captures the worst amplifier among velocity, detectability,
    and reversibility. A risk that is invisible (D=5) OR irreversible (R=5)
    OR instant (V=5) fundamentally changes character regardless of
    the other amplifiers.

  example:
    risk: "Data corruption from schema drift"
    P: 3
    I: 4
    V: 2
    D: 5  # Silent corruption - no error signal
    R: 4
    composite: "3 × 4 × max(2,5,4) = 3 × 4 × 5 = 60"

---
flags:
  fat_tail:
    symbol: FAT_TAIL
    criteria: "Impact may be 100× worse than score suggests"
    detection_questions:
      - "Is impact power-law distributed?"
      - "Could 'Impact: 5' actually be catastrophically worse?"
      - "Are historical extremes much worse than averages?"
    implication: |
      Composite score is UNDERESTIMATE.
      Use P90/P99 impact estimates instead of expected value.
      Do not rely on standard cost-benefit analysis.

  non_ergodic:
    symbol: NON_ERGODIC
    criteria: "Survival uncertain if this materializes"
    detection_questions:
      - "If this hits, can we continue operating?"
      - "Is this potentially 'game over'?"
      - "Does ensemble average (across 100 projects) differ from time-series (our ONE project)?"
    implication: |
      Expected value optimization is WRONG.
      Survival first, optimization second.
      TERMINATE or TRANSFER strongly preferred.
      TOLERATE requires extraordinary justification.

  low_confidence:
    symbol: LOW_CONFIDENCE
    criteria: "Probability estimate unreliable"
    detection_questions:
      - "Is this Knight-Uncertainty (unknown distribution)?"
      - "Are we guessing the probability?"
      - "Would different team members give very different P scores?"
    implication: |
      Do not treat low-confidence P=2 same as high-confidence P=2.
      Consider scenario planning instead of expected value.
      Mark as requiring investigation to reduce uncertainty.

tiers:
  critical:
    range: "≥60"
    color: "RED"
    response: "Immediate attention required"

  high:
    range: "30-59"
    color: "ORANGE"
    response: "Active mitigation required"

  medium:
    range: "10-29"
    color: "YELLOW"
    response: "Monitor and mitigate if practical"

  low:
    range: "<10"
    color: "GREEN"
    response: "Accept or treat opportunistically"

calibration_guidance:
  prevent_inflation:
    - "Use anchors, not intuition"
    - "Compare to reference risks"
    - "Ask: Is this REALLY a 5? What would an actual 5 look like?"

  prevent_deflation:
    - "Consider worst realistic case, not best case"
    - "Apply survivorship correction (historical data underestimates)"
    - "Check for normalcy bias (it's always been fine...)"

  cross_check:
    - "Would independent scorer give similar result?"
    - "Does score match gut feeling? If not, investigate"
    - "Are similar risks scored consistently?"

# USAGE SUMMARY:
#
# 1. Score each dimension (P, I, V, D, R) using anchors
# 2. Calculate composite: P × I × max(V, D, R)
# 3. Check flag criteria, apply flags
# 4. Assign tier based on composite
# 5. For flagged risks: note implications in mitigation strategy
