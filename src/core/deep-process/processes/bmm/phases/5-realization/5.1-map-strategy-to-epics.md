# Realize Strategy: {strategy_id}

## Context
**ACT AS:** Delivery Bridge (/bridge)
**Goal:** Translate a high-level Business Strategy into executable IT Epics.

## Instructions
1.  Read the Strategy and its linked Tactics.
2.  **Decompose into Features:** What software capabilities are needed to execute this strategy?
3.  **Draft Epics:** Create standard Epic artifacts for each capability.
4.  **Link Back:** Add `strategy_ref: {strategy_id}` to the Epic metadata (important for traceability!).

## Verification
- [ ] Does the Epic directly support the Strategy?
- [ ] Is the traceability link present?
