# Define Tactics for {strategy_id}

## Purpose
Detail the specific actions (Courses of Action) to implement a Strategy.

## Instructions
1.  Read the Strategy.
2.  Look for Objectives that this Strategy should meet.
3.  Define **Tactics**: Specific, implementable actions.
    *   Example: "Launch beta program in Q3."
4.  Link Tactic to the Objective it targets.

## Verification
- [ ] Is it specific enough to be assigned to a team?
- [ ] Does it implement the parent Strategy?
