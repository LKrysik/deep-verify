# Quality Gate: Verify Strategy {strategy_id}

## Purpose
Ensure the Strategy is sound, aligned with Mission, and theoretically feasible before defining Tactics.

## Instructions
1.  **Invoke Deep Verify:** Run the following command (or simulate it):
    `deep-verify --target artifacts/bmm/means/{strategy_id}.yaml --mode standard`
2.  **Analyze Report:** Look for "REJECT" or "CRITICAL" findings.
3.  **Action:**
    *   If **PASS**: Proceed.
    *   If **FAIL**: You MUST update the Strategy YAML to address the findings.
4.  **Save Report:** Save the verification output to `artifacts/bmm/means/{strategy_id}.verify.md`.

## Quality Gate Criteria
- [ ] Deep Verify verdict is ACCEPT.
- [ ] No CRITICAL findings remain unaddressed.
