# Identify Unknowns

## Purpose
Proactively discover risks, assumptions, and knowledge gaps in the crystallized idea before proceeding.

## Instructions

1.  **Analyze Input:** Read the `artifacts/idea.md` file created in the previous step.
2.  **Scan for Unknowns:** Use the `unknown-detector` logic to scan the idea. Ask:
    *   **Assumptions:** What are we assuming is true without evidence? (e.g., "Users will want X")
    *   **Technical Gaps:** Do we know how to build this? Are there tricky dependencies?
    *   **Market Gaps:** Do we know if this is viable?
3.  **Categorize:** For each discovered item, determine:
    *   Type: `technical`, `user`, `market`, `feasibility`
    *   Priority: `high`, `medium`, `low`
4.  **Output:** Update the `.state/unknowns.yaml` file with the list of discovered unknowns.

## Output Requirements

Update `.state/unknowns.yaml` using the standard schema. Each entry must have a unique ID (`UNK-XXX`) and a clear description.

## State Updates
After successful execution, the engine will update:
*   `phase_progress`: 0.8
