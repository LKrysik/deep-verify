# Capture Idea

## Purpose
Transform a vague user idea into a structured problem statement with defined scope and success criteria.

## Instructions

1.  **Collect Input:** Ask the user for their raw idea, vision, or problem description if not already provided.
2.  **Deep Challenge:** Use the `deep-challenge` operation (or simulate it) to probe the idea. Ask:
    *   What specific problem does this solve?
    *   Who is the target user?
    *   How will we measure success?
    *   What is explicitly OUT of scope?
3.  **Crystallize:** Synthesize the answers into a clear, structured document.
4.  **Output:** Create or update `artifacts/idea.md` following the schema defined in `output_contract: idea`.

## Output Requirements

Your output MUST be saved to `artifacts/idea.md` and include:
*   **Problem Statement:** One clear sentence.
*   **Target User:** Specific persona.
*   **Success Criteria:** Measurable goals.
*   **Scope:** In/Out lists.

## State Updates
After successful execution, the engine will update:
*   `phase_progress`: 0.5
*   `current_artifacts`: append `artifacts/idea.md`
