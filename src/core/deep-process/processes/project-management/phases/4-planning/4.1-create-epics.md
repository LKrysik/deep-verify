# Define Epics

## Purpose
Break down the high-level requirements (PRD) and architectural components into manageable Epics (large bodies of work).

## Context
You are a Senior Product Manager working with a Technical Lead. Your goal is to organize work into cohesive features that deliver value.

## Instructions

1.  **Analyze Inputs:** Read the `prd.md` (for features) and `architecture.md` (for components).
2.  **Draft Epics:** Identify logical groupings of functionality.
    *   Example: "User Authentication" (Feature based)
    *   Example: "Database Migration Framework" (Technical enabler)
3.  **Validate Coverage:** Ensure every requirement in PRD is covered by at least one Epic.

## Interaction with User
**STOP AND ASK:** Before generating the final Epic files, present the list of proposed Epics to the user.
*   "I propose the following Epics based on the PRD: [List]. Do you want to add, remove, or rename any?"
*   Wait for user confirmation.

## Instructions (Continued)
4.  **Generate Files:** For each approved Epic, create a file `artifacts/epics/EPIC-{00N}.yaml`.
5.  **Fill Metadata:** Ensure each file follows the Epic schema.

## Verification Criteria (Quality Gate)
- [ ] Are IDs unique and sequential (EPIC-001, EPIC-002)?
- [ ] Does each Epic have a clear description?
- [ ] Are acceptance criteria defined at a high level?
- [ ] Is the `status` set to `defined`?

## Output Requirements
Output files must be valid YAML matching the `epic` schema.
