  - id: "PM-001"
    name: "Wishful Deadline Syndrome"
    description: |
      Deadlines set based on business desire rather than technical reality.
      The date is fixed before scope is understood.

    signature:
      - "Date announced before estimation"
      - "'We need it by X' as starting point"

      - "Date-driven not scope-driven planning"

    description: |
      Adding people to a late project makes it later. Communication overhead
