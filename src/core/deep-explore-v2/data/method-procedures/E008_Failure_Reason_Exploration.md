# E008: Failure Reason Exploration

## Purpose

Transform vague fear into a concrete map of risks. This is NOT pessimism - it's controlled risk exploration.

## Core Question

```
"What EXACTLY would have to be true for this to NOT work?"
```

## Why This Matters

Fear is usually a fog. This method turns fog into a map.

Instead of: "I'm afraid this won't work"
You get: "Here are the 7 specific things that could fail, and 4 of them I can address"

---

## Procedure

### 1. Generate Failure Reasons

Force yourself to list 5-10 specific reasons why it might fail:

```
WHY THIS MIGHT NOT WORK:
1. [reason]
2. [reason]
3. [reason]
4. [reason]
5. [reason]
...
```

Don't filter. Include everything, even things that seem unlikely.

### 2. Classify Each Reason

```
For each failure reason, classify:

STRUCTURAL (physics, law, math, biology, economics):
These are hard limits. If true, they cannot be worked around.
• [reason] - hard limit because: ___

OPERATIONAL (time, resources, skills, access):
These are constraints. They can potentially be addressed.
• [reason] - constraint because: ___

COGNITIVE (wrong assumptions, missing knowledge):
These might not be real. They need verification.
• [reason] - assumption because: ___
```

### 3. Test Each Class

```
STRUCTURAL:
□ Is this truly a hard limit?
□ Has anyone found a way around it?
□ Am I sure about the underlying constraint?

OPERATIONAL:
□ Can I acquire the resource/skill/time?
□ Is there a cheaper alternative?
□ Can I partner/outsource?

COGNITIVE:
□ How do I know this is true?
□ What evidence do I have?
□ What would change my mind?
```

### 4. Transform Fear to Map

```
UNCERTAINTY MAP:

REAL BLOCKERS (confirmed hard limits):
• [reason] - cannot proceed unless: ___

ADDRESSABLE (operational, have solutions):
• [reason] - solution: ___

UNVERIFIED (cognitive, need research):
• [reason] - to verify: ___

IMAGINARY (no evidence, pure fear):
• [reason] - evidence against: ___
```

## Output

```
FAILURE REASON EXPLORATION

Original fear: "[vague fear]"

BREAKDOWN:
┌────────────────────────────┬────────────┬────────────────────┐
│ Failure Reason             │ Type       │ Status             │
├────────────────────────────┼────────────┼────────────────────┤
│ [reason 1]                 │ STRUCTURAL │ BLOCKER / OK       │
│ [reason 2]                 │ OPERATIONAL│ ADDRESSABLE        │
│ [reason 3]                 │ COGNITIVE  │ UNVERIFIED         │
│ [reason 4]                 │ COGNITIVE  │ IMAGINARY          │
└────────────────────────────┴────────────┴────────────────────┘

REAL BLOCKERS: [count] - [list]
ADDRESSABLE: [count] - [solutions]
NEEDS RESEARCH: [count] - [what to verify]

FEAR CLARITY: [fog → map]
```

## Integration

Use in: Step 0 (when you have fears), Step 4 (Challenge)
