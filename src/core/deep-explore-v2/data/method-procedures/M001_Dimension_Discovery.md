# M001: Dimension Discovery

## Purpose

Identify all axes of choice - the fundamental dimensions of the decision.

## Core Question

```
"What are the independent categories where we must choose?"
```

## Procedure

### 1. Extract from Research

```
From Step 0-1, what choices emerged?

"We could do X or Y" → possible dimension
"There's a trade-off between A and B" → possible dimension
"We need to decide about Z" → possible dimension

RAW CHOICES:
• [choice 1]
• [choice 2]
• [choice 3]
```

### 2. Group into Dimensions

```
A DIMENSION is an axis where you must pick ONE option.

GROUP:
• [choice 1, choice 2] → Dimension: [name]
• [choice 3, choice 4] → Dimension: [name]
```

### 3. Check Independence

```
For each pair of dimensions:

Are [D1] and [D2] truly independent?
• Can you choose D1:A with any D2 option? [Y/N]
• If NO → they may be sub-options or dependent

INDEPENDENT: [list]
DEPENDENT: [list] - depends on: ___
```

### 4. Expansion

```
For each dimension, ask:
• "What would an expert add?"
• "What's the unconventional choice?"
• "What would someone with 10x resources choose?"
• "What would someone with 0.1x resources choose?"
```

### 5. Quality Check

```
□ At least 3 dimensions? (if not, oversimplifying?)
□ Each has at least 2 options? (if not, is it really a choice?)
□ No dimension has only 1 option after constraints?
```

## Output

```
DIMENSIONS:
├── D1: [name] - type: INDEPENDENT
├── D2: [name] - type: INDEPENDENT
├── D3: [name] - type: DEPENDENT on D1
└── ...

QUALITY: [PASS/NEEDS WORK]
```
