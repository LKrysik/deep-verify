# E012: Fundamental Block Analysis

## Purpose

Find out if there's a true "wall" - one condition that CANNOT be worked around.

## Core Question

```
"Is there ONE condition that, if not met, makes this IMPOSSIBLE?"
```

## Why This Matters

Most people assume a wall exists without checking.

Three possibilities:
1. Wall exists → Find it fast, stop wasting time
2. Wall doesn't exist → Fear is cognitive, not real
3. Wall exists but can be moved → Find the workaround

Finding the wall (or confirming no wall) is the most valuable exploration.

## Procedure

### 1. List Suspected Walls

```
"What do I think makes this impossible?"

SUSPECTED WALLS:
1. [suspected blocker]
2. [suspected blocker]
3. [suspected blocker]
```

### 2. Test Each for "Wall-ness"

```
For each suspected wall, ask:

WALL TEST:
□ Is this truly IMPOSSIBLE to work around? [Y/N]
□ Has ANYONE ever worked around this? [Y/N]
□ Is this a LAW (physics, math, law) or a CONSTRAINT (can be changed)? [LAW/CONSTRAINT]
□ What would it take to remove this blocker? [description]

CLASSIFICATION:
[ ] TRUE WALL - cannot be removed
[ ] FALSE WALL - feels blocking but has workaround
[ ] MOVEABLE WALL - blocking but can be addressed
```

### 3. Verify True Walls

```
If you found a TRUE WALL:

VERIFICATION:
□ What makes this a law, not a constraint?
□ Why can no one work around it?
□ Am I sure about my understanding?

EVIDENCE:
• [evidence that this is truly impossible]
• [who else has hit this wall]
```

### 4. Find Wall Workarounds

```
If wall seems true but you still want to proceed:

WORKAROUND SEARCH:
• Can I go OVER the wall? (different approach)
• Can I go AROUND the wall? (different path)
• Can I go UNDER the wall? (different level)
• Can I MOVE the wall? (change the constraint)
• Can I make the wall IRRELEVANT? (change the goal)

WORKAROUND: [if found]
```

### 5. Accept or Pivot

```
IF TRUE WALL WITH NO WORKAROUND:
→ This path is blocked
→ Valuable learning: don't waste more time here
→ Look for different goal or different approach

IF NO TRUE WALL:
→ Fear was cognitive, not structural
→ Proceed with confidence
→ Address operational/cognitive concerns
```

## Types of True Walls

```
PHYSICS: Can't violate laws of physics
Example: Can't transmit information faster than light

MATHEMATICS: Can't violate logical constraints
Example: Can't have algorithm that solves halting problem

LEGAL: Can't violate laws (unless willing to break them)
Example: Can't do X without license in jurisdiction Y

ECONOMIC: Can't do at that cost point
Example: Can't profitably serve market at price X

BIOLOGICAL: Can't violate human limits
Example: Can't work 168 hours/week sustainably
```

## Output

```
FUNDAMENTAL BLOCK ANALYSIS

Suspected walls: [count]

ANALYSIS:
┌────────────────────────────┬────────────┬────────────────────┐
│ Suspected Wall             │ Status     │ Workaround         │
├────────────────────────────┼────────────┼────────────────────┤
│ [wall 1]                   │ FALSE WALL │ [how to pass]      │
│ [wall 2]                   │ MOVEABLE   │ [how to move]      │
│ [wall 3]                   │ TRUE WALL  │ NONE               │
└────────────────────────────┴────────────┴────────────────────┘

TRUE WALLS FOUND: [count]
• [wall] - why true: ___ - consequence: ___

FALSE WALLS CLEARED: [count]
• [wall] - why false: ___ - path forward: ___

CONCLUSION:
[ ] Path is blocked by true wall → Pivot
[ ] No true walls found → Proceed
```
