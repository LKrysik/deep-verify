# Coverage Scoring Rules for Deep Explore V2

scoring:
  # Knowledge expansion
  dimension_discovered: 2.0
  option_enumerated: 1.0
  unknown_unknown_surfaced: 1.5
  assumption_falsified: 1.0

  # Verification
  consequence_verified: 1.0
  consequence_assumed: 0.3

  # Understanding

thresholds:
  # Default thresholds (SE mode)
  comprehensive:
    min_score: 25
    meaning: "Most of decision space explored"
  adequate:
    min_score: 15
    meaning: "Key areas covered, minor gaps possible"
  partial:
    min_score: 8
    meaning: "Major gaps likely, proceed with caution"
  insufficient:
    min_score: 0
    meaning: "Premature to decide, more exploration needed"

# Mode-adjusted thresholds
# QE skips steps, so lower thresholds are appropriate
# DE is thorough, so higher thresholds expected
# FE focuses on fears not breadth, so different scale
mode_thresholds:
  QE:  # Quick Explore - reduced expectations
    comprehensive: 12
    adequate: 8
    partial: 4
    insufficient: 0
    note: "QE is intentionally light; lower scores are expected"

  SE:  # Standard Explore - default thresholds
    comprehensive: 25
    adequate: 15
    partial: 8
    insufficient: 0

  DE:  # Deep Explore - higher expectations
    comprehensive: 35
    adequate: 25
    partial: 15
    insufficient: 0
    note: "DE invests more time; expect higher coverage"

  FE:  # Fear-Based - different scoring focus
    comprehensive: 20
    adequate: 12
    partial: 6
    insufficient: 0
    note: "FE scores on fear resolution, not option breadth"
    primary_metrics:
      - fear_classified
      - false_wall_identified
      - true_wall_confirmed
      - controllable_concern_found

  FSE:  # Fearful Standard - combines both
    comprehensive: 30
    adequate: 20
    partial: 12
    insufficient: 0
    note: "FSE combines fear + option mapping"
