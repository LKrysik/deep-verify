# Coverage Scoring Rules for Deep Explore V2

scoring:
  # Knowledge expansion
  dimension_discovered: 2.0
  option_enumerated: 1.0
  unknown_unknown_surfaced: 1.5
  assumption_falsified: 1.0

  # Verification
  consequence_verified: 1.0
  consequence_assumed: 0.3

  # Understanding
  boundary_identified: 0.5
  causal_relationship_mapped: 0.5

  # Challenge
  premortem_cause_found: 0.3
  black_swan_identified: 0.3

  # Fear-Based Mode (FE)
  fear_classified: 0.5
  false_wall_identified: 1.0
  true_wall_confirmed: 1.0
  controllable_concern_found: 0.5
  success_path_discovered: 1.5
  comparable_analyzed: 0.5

# Thresholds by mode
# Each mode has different expectations based on scope and focus
# Use thresholds[MODE] to get appropriate levels for current execution
thresholds:
  QE:  # Quick Explore - reduced expectations
    comprehensive: 12
    adequate: 8
    partial: 4
    insufficient: 0
    note: "QE is intentionally light; lower scores are expected"

  SE:  # Standard Explore - default thresholds
    comprehensive: 25   # Most of decision space explored
    adequate: 15        # Key areas covered, minor gaps possible
    partial: 8          # Major gaps likely, proceed with caution
    insufficient: 0     # Premature to decide, more exploration needed

  DE:  # Deep Explore - higher expectations
    comprehensive: 35
    adequate: 25
    partial: 15
    insufficient: 0
    note: "DE invests more time; expect higher coverage"

  FE:  # Fear-Based - different scoring focus
    comprehensive: 20
    adequate: 12
    partial: 6
    insufficient: 0
    note: "FE scores on fear resolution, not option breadth"
    primary_metrics:
      - fear_classified
      - false_wall_identified
      - true_wall_confirmed
      - controllable_concern_found

  FSE:  # Fearful Standard - combines both
    comprehensive: 30
    adequate: 20
    partial: 12
    insufficient: 0
    note: "FSE combines fear + option mapping"
